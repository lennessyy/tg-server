== Detailed List of New and Modified Features

=== Backup and Restore Enhancements

* **xref:tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:point-in-time-restore.adoc[Point in Time Restore]**: 
Users can roll back the database to a moment they select, not only the time of an available backup snapshots.

* **xref:tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:configurations.adoc#_configure_backup_to_aws_s3_endpoint[Role ARN for Backup to AWS S3 buckets]**: 
Users can use AWS Role ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) for convenient and secure management of backups.

* The **xref:{page-component-version}@tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:backup-cluster.adoc#_data_backup[--custom-tag flag]** gives users more control over the naming of backup files.

* See also xref:_high_availability_ha_enhancements[]

=== Security Enhancements

[#finer_grain_query_privileges]
* **xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:fine-grained-query-privileges.adoc[Fine-grained Privileges on Queries]**:
gives adminstrators finer control over who may do what actions with which objects:
- Allows privileges to be granted/revoked at the query level.
- Adds new query privileges OWNERSHIP, INSTALL and EXECUTE, and splits  WRITE to CREATE, UPDATE and DROP.

* **xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:jwt-token.adoc#_usage_of_gsql_jwt_token[JWT Authentication]**:
JWT authorization/authentication is more secure than the plaintext tokens used in earlier TigerGraph versions.
Users can generate and use JWT tokens when sending REST requests to the GSQL or REST servers.

* **xref:tigergraph-server:security:password-policy.adoc[Password Complexity and Rotation Rules]**: 
Administrators can specify rules for the complexity of passwords and how long or how many times a password may be used, in order to improve security and help organizations to satisfy compliance requirements.

* **xref:tigergraph-server:troubleshooting:audit-log.adoc[Expanded Audit Log Coverage]**: 
Audit logs now include `gadmin` activity, for more complete audit coverage.

=== High Availability (HA) Enhancements

* **xref:{page-component-version}@tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-loading-v2.adoc[Data Loading HA (Beta)]**:
If the database is replicated, this data loading mode offers faster loading, reduced disk usage, and HA with automatic failover.
Available for TigerGraph's xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:manage-data-source.adoc[data streaming connectors] for cloud storage, Kafka, data warehouses, and Spark.

* **xref:tigergraph-server:system-management:change-data-capture/cdc-overview.adoc#_cdc_ha[Change Data Capture (CDC) HA]**:
CDC continues to function as long as at least one replica per partition is online.
Previously, Replica 1 needed to remain operational.

* [4.1.1] CDC messages have a "graph" field to specify which graph was affected.

* **Backup HA**:
Backups remain available even if a node fails.
Previously, backups were unavailable if a node failed.

=== Data Streaming/Connector Enhancements

* **xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:managing-loading-job.adoc#_show_loading_error[Malformed Loading Data Inspector]**:
`SHOW LOADING ERROR` presents a sample of malformed data lines and their error types to an authorized user,
enabling them to quickly locate and diagnose loading problems.

* **xref:gsql-ref:querying:data-types.adoc#_file_object[Data Export to AWS S3]**:
Export query results in CSV format directly to AWS S3 buckets for efficient data sharing and analysis

* **xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:read-to-spark-dataframe.adoc[Stream Data into Spark]**:
Using the Spark data source reader API, users can run TigerGraph queries and stream the output to Spark as DataFrames.
Streaming the output lifts the 2GB query response size limitation for non-streaming output.

* **Notification for Stuck Loader**:
If loading is stuck or acting abnormally, the loader sends an alert message to the console,
including a diagnosis, enabling users to take timely action.

* See also xref:_high_availability_ha_enhancements[]

=== System Management and Monitoring Enhancements ===
* New options and optimized behavior in `GADMIN CONFIG APPLY` to 
xref:tigergraph-server:system-management:management-commands.adoc#_gadmin_config_apply[restart only those services] that have been affected by configuration changes.

* **xref:{page-component-version}@tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_monitor_system_metrics_openmetrics_format[Enhanced Metrics Reports]** Total and available capacity for CPU and memory are now reported by the `/informant/metrics` endpoint.

== Known Issues and Limitations

[cols="4", separator=¦ ]
|===
¦ Description ¦ Found In ¦ Workaround ¦ Fixed In

¦When using xref:tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:database-import-export.adoc[Import All] if a users schema size in the `.zip` file is exceedingly large, the import may fail with an error messages like this:

`Large catalog file key: /1/ReplicaList.json`

¦ 3.2
a¦
* 3.9 and below users need to run the import process manually by executing the GSQL scripts in the `.zip`.
* 3.10.0 and above users should xref:tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:single-graph-import-export.adoc[import single or smaller batches of multiple graphs].
¦ TBD

a¦ If importing a role, policy, or function that has a different signature or content from the existing one, the one being imported will be skipped and not aborted.

.For example:
* If the original function is: `create function lib1.func2(int param1, float param2, string param3) returns (bool) {}`.
* And the user imports the new function: `create function lib1.func2(int param1) returns (bool) {}`. This second one will be skipped.
¦ 3.10.0
¦ Users need to re-create (delete and create) the imported role, policy, or function manually, and make sure that the importing one meets the requirements set by the existing one.
¦ TBD

a¦ xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:rbac-row-policy/row-policy-overview.adoc[Row Policy (Preview Feature)] does not yet filter or check vertex attribute data in upsert operations.

Such as,

* A query with insert statements.
* A file or Kafka loading job.
* A DDL loading request.
* Or a standard upsert request.
¦ 3.10.0
¦ Users should restrict the access of creating/running queries and loading jobs for roles related to row policy.
¦ TBD

¦ In file INPUT and OUTPUT policy, if there exists 2 path (`path1` and `path2`) in the configured policy list and `path1` is parent path of `path2`, then `path1` may not be effective.
¦ 3.2 and 3.10.0
¦ Users should avoid using paths if they are nested.

For example, avoid this scenario, path2 = `"/tmp/more"` and path1= `"/tmp"`.
¦ 3.10.1

¦ It has been observed that an issue happens when RESTPP will send a request to all gpes, and if one is down, the request sent to it will `timeout`.
Including the `consistency_check` request will also mark as `timeout`.
¦ 3.10.0
a¦
. Run `/rebuildnow` to rebuild all the segments.
+
[NOTE]
====
Running `/rebuildnow` when one gpe is down will result in the request timeout. This does not mean the request failed, instead only the currently running GPE will do the rebuild, and any rebuild requests sent to the down GPEs will result in a timeout.
====
. Run `/data_consistency_check?realtime=false` to check the consistency.
¦ TBD

¦ While running `export graph` if the disk space is not enough, or the data has not been detected, the export data will get stuck loading.
¦ 3.10.0
¦ Restart all services in Admin Portal or the backend.
¦ TBD

¦ `[tg_]ExprFunction.hpp` will be automatically merged while importing single graphs. In some cases, query compilation may fail.
¦ 3.10.0
¦ See xref:tigergraph-server:backup-and-restore:single-graph-import-export.adoc#_known_issues_and_workarounds[Known Issues and Workarounds]
¦ TBD

¦ Upgrading from a previous version of TigerGraph has known issues.
¦ 3.10.0
¦ See section xref:tigergraph-server:installation:upgrade.adoc#_known_issues_and_workarounds[Known Issues and Workarounds] for more details.
¦ TBD

¦ Input Policy feature has known limitations.
¦ 3.10.0
¦ See section xref:tigergraph-server:security:gsql-file-input-policy.adoc#_limitations[Input Policy Limitations] for more details.
¦ TBD

¦ Change Data Capture (CDC) feature has known limitations.
¦ 3.10.0
¦ See section xref:tigergraph-server:system-management:change-data-capture/cdc-overview.adoc#_cdc_limitations[CDC Limitations] for more details.
¦ TBD

¦ If the `FROM` clause pattern is a multi-hop and the `ACCUM` clause reads both primitive and container type attributes or accumulators of a vertex, the internal query rewriting logic may generate an invalid rewritten output.
¦ 3.9.3
¦ This results in the error message: `It is not allowed to mix primitive types and accumulator types in GroupByAccum`.
¦ TBD

¦ Users may see a high CPU usage caused by Kafka prefetching when there is no query or posting request.
¦ 3.9.3
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ GSQL query compiler may report a false error for a valid query using a vertex set variable (e.g. `Ent` in `reverse_traversal_syntax_err`) to specify the midpoint or target vertex of a path in a FROM clause pattern.
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ If a loading job is expected to load from a large batch of files or Kafka queues (e.g. more than 500), the job’s status may not be updated for an extended period of time.
¦ 3.9.3
¦ In this case, users should check the loader log file as an additional reference for loading status.
¦ TBD

¦ When a GPE/GSE is turned off right after initiating a loading job, the loading job is terminated internally. However, users may still observe the loading job as running on their end.
¦ 3.9.3
¦ Please see xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:running-a-loading-job.adoc[Troubleshooting Loading Job Delays] for additional details.
¦ TBD

¦ For v3.9.1 and v3.9.2 when inserting a new edge in `GPR` and `INTERPRET` mode, the GPE will print out a warning message because a discriminator string is not set for new-inserted edges. Creating an inconsistent problem in delta message for GPR and `INTERPRET` mode.
¦ 3.9.2
¦ Please see xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:running-a-loading-job.adoc[Troubleshooting Loading Job Delays] for additional details.
¦ 3.9.3

¦ GSQL `EXPORT GRAPH` may fail and cause a GPE to crash when UDT type has a fixed STRING size.
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ After a global loading job is running for a while a fail can be encountered when getting the loading status due to `KAFKASTRM-LL` not being online, when actually the status is online.
Then the global loading process will exit and fail the local job after timeout while waiting the global loading job to finish.
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ When the memory usage approaches 100%, the system may stall because the process to elect a new GSE leader did not complete correctly.
¦ TBD
¦ This lockup can be cleared by restarting the GSE.
¦ TBD

¦ If the CPU and memory utilization remain high for an extended period during a schema change on a cluster, a GSE follower could crash, if it is requested to insert data belonging to the new schema before it has finished handling the schema update.
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ When available memory becomes very low in a cluster and there are a large number of vertex deletions to process, some remote servers might have difficulty receiving the metadata needed to be aware of all the deletions across the full cluster. The mismatched metadata will cause the GPE to go down.
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ Subqueries with SET<VERTEX> parameters cannot be run in Distributed or Interpreted mode.
¦ TBD
¦ (xref:3.9@gsql-ref:querying:operators-and-expressions.adoc#_subquery_limitations[Limited Distributed model support] is added in 3.9.2.)
¦ TBD

¦ Upgrading a cluster with 10 or more nodes to v3.9.0 requires a patch.
¦ 3.9
¦ Please contact TigerGraph Support if you have a cluster this large. Clusters with nine or fewer nodes do not require the patch.
¦ 3.9.1

¦ Downsizing a cluster to have fewer nodes requires a patch.
¦ 3.9.0
¦ Please contact TigerGraph Support.
¦ TBD

¦ During peak system load, loading jobs may sometimes display an inaccurate loading status.
¦ 3.9.0
¦ This issue can be remediated by continuing to run `SHOW LOADING STATUS` periodically to display the up-to-date status.
¦ TBD

¦ When managing many loading jobs, pausing a data loading job may result in longer-than-usual response time.
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ Schema change jobs may fail if the server is experiencing a heavy workload.
¦ TBD
¦ To remedy this, avoid applying schema changes during peak load times.
¦ TBD

¦ User-defined Types (UDT) do not work if exceeding string size limit.
¦ TBD
¦ Avoid using UDT for variable length strings that cannot be limited by size.
¦ TBD

¦ Unable to handle the tab character `\t` properly in AVRO or Parquet file loading. It will be loaded as `\\t`.
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ If `System.Backup.Local.Enable` is set to `true`, this also enables a daily full backup at 12:00am UTC.
¦ 3.9.0
¦ TBD
¦ 3.9.1

¦ The data streaming connector does not handle NULL values; the connector may operate properly if a NULL value is submitted.
¦ TBD
¦ Users should replace NULL with an alternate value, such as empty string "" for STRING data, 0 for INT data, etc.  (NULL is not a valid value for the TigerGraph graph data store.)
¦ TBD

¦ Automatic message removal is an Alpha feature of the Kafka connector. It has several xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:data-loading:load-from-cloud.adoc#_known_issues_with_loading[known issues].
¦ TBD
¦ TBD
¦ TBD

¦ The `DATETIME` data type is not supported by the `PRINT … TO CSV` statement.
¦ 3.9.0
¦ TBD
¦ 3.9.1

=== Compatibility Issues

[cols="2", separator=¦ ]
|===
¦ Description ¦ Version Introduced

¦A full export package now includes access policies and template queries.
¦v4.1.0

¦ Users could encounter file input/output policy violations when upgrading a TigerGraph version.
See xref:tigergraph-server:security:gsql-file-input-policy.adoc#_backward_compatibility[Input policy backward compatibility.]
¦ v3.10.0

¦ When a PRINT argument is an expression, the output uses the expression as the key (label) for that output value.
To better support Antlr processing, PRINT now removes any spaces from that key. For example, `count(DISTINCT @@ids)` becomes `count(DISTINCT@@ids)`.
¦ v3.9.3+

¦ Betweenness Centrality algorithm: `reverse_edge_type (STRING)` parameter changed to `reverse_edge_type_set (SET<STRING>)`, to be consistent with `edge_type_set` and similar algorithms.
¦ v3.9.2+

¦ For vertices with string-type primary IDs, vertices whose ID is an empty string will now be rejected.
¦ v3.9.2+

¦ The default mode for the Kafka Connector changed from EOF="false" to EOF="true".
¦ v3.9.2+

¦ The default retention time for two monitoring services `Informant.RetentionPeriodDays` and `TS3.RetentionPeriodDays` has reduced from 30 to 7 days.
¦ v3.9.2+

¦ The filter for `/informant/metrics/get/cpu-memory` now accepts a list of ServiceDescriptors instead of a single ServiceDescriptor.
¦ v3.9.2+

a¦ Some user-defined functions (UDFs) may no longer be accepted due to xref:security:index.adoc#_udf_file_scanning[increased security screening].

* UDFs may no longer be called `to_string()`. This is now a built-in GSQL function.
* UDF names may no longer use the `tg_` prefix. Any user-defined function that began with `tg_` must be renamed or removed in `ExprFunctions.hpp`.
¦ v3.9+
