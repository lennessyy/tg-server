= Service Logs Tracking

This guide describes how to obtain log information from the service logs.

Service logs track information about user actions such as the action taken, the user permissions, the client used, and so on.

Logging in the same files can also be found for login, and all other requests sent to any of these services.

== REST endpoint request history

All requests made to TigerGraph's REST endpoints are recorded by the RESTPP logs and Nginx logs. Information available in the logs includes:

* Timestamp of the request
* API request parameters
* Request Status
* User information (when RESTPP authentication is turned on)

RESTPP is responsible for many tasks in the TigerGraph internal architecture and records many internal API calls, which can be hard to distinguish from manual requests. When xref:user-access:enabling-user-authentication.adoc#_enable_restpp_authentication[RESTPP authentication is on], the RESTPP log will record the user information and mark a call if it is made by an internal API. Therefore, you can use the command below to filter for manual requests:


[source, console]
----
# In the restpp log directory
$ grep -i "requestinfo" log.INFO | grep -v "__INTERNAL_API__"

# All requests exluding the ones made by internal API
I0315 21:11:59.666318 14535 handler.cpp:351] RequestInfo|,1.RESTPP_1_1.1615842719666.N,NNN,0,0,0|user:tigergraph|api:v2|function:NoSchema|graph_name:social|libudf:

`RequestInfo` contains the ID of the request, which you can use to look up more information on the request :

Here is an example of using a request ID to look up a request in the restpp log:

[source, console]
----
$ grep "1615842719666" log.INFO

# Returns all information about the specific request
# RawRequest log is captured at the entry point of a query

== Query execution via RESTPP

`NGINX#1.out` log contains the endpoint accessed, the IP, and the client.
RESTPP `log.INFO` contains the query run, user who ran it, and the graph it ran against.

In a cluster, the log for the node that processed the request contains the details.
For example, if the request was routed to m3, the log would be in `NGINX#3.out` on m3 or RESTPP `log.INFO` on m3.

Example query:
[source, console]
----
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 4m6nh1rakn60430rjf5asv" <ip_address>:14240/restpp/query/ldbc_snb/example_query

== Query execution via GraphStudio

Nginx `NGINX#1.out` log contains the endpoint accessed, the IP from where it was accessed, and the client.
GraphStudio (GUI) `GUI#1.out` contains the query run, user who ran it, and the graph it ran against.

== Query execution via GSQL CLI

The `NGINX#1.out` log contains the endpoint accessed, the IP from where it was accessed, and the client.
GSQL `log.INFO` contains all commands run during the client session, including queries run, and graph queries ran against.

[NOTE]
In a cluster, the GSQL request will be served by the current GSQL leader which could be any node running the GSQL service.

== Monitor user management tasks

User management activities, such as logins, role and privilege changes are recorded in the GSQL logs in the folder `gsql`.

To view recent activities, use the symlink `log.INFO`.
To filter for information that you need, you can use Linux commands such as https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/grep1.html[`grep`] and http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/tail1.html[`tail`].

For example, to view recent changes in roles, you can run the following command in the `gsql` log directory:

[source, console]
----
$ grep -i "role" log.INFO

# Returns all lines containing the word "role"
#                        username     source IP
I@20210312 22:41:16.167 tigergraph|127.0.0.1:45854|00000000077 (BaseHandler.java:133) Received|POST|/gsql/roles?action=grant&role=globaldesigner&name=lennessy|0

----

To view login activities, search `log.INFO` for `"login"` instead.

[source, console]
----
$ grep -i "login" log.INFO

# Returns all lines containing the world "login"
