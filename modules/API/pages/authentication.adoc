:description: How authentication works in TigerGraph REST API.

TigerGraph's RESTful APIs communicate with either the REST{pp} server on port 9000 or the GSQL server on port 14240.
Each server uses different methods of authentication.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of 3.10.0, the use of plaintext tokens in authentication is deprecated.
Use xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:jwt-token.adoc[] instead.

== REST{pp} Server Requests

TigerGraph REST{pp} endpoints are public by default: anyone with access to the HTTP ports of the TigerGraph server can run your endpoints.
When xref:user-access:enabling-user-authentication.adoc[REST{pp} authentication is enabled], then a valid authorization token must be included in the header.

The REST{pp} server implements OAuth 2.0-style authorization as follows:

. Each user xref:user-access:user-credentials.adoc#_create_a_secret[can create one or more *secrets* (unique pseudorandom strings)]. Each secret is associated with a particular user and the user's privileges for a particular graph.
. Anyone who has this secret can invoke a special REST endpoint to xref:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_request_a_token[generate authorization *tokens*] (other pseudorandom strings).
. An authorization token can then be used to perform TigerGraph database operations via other REST endpoints. Each token will expire after a certain period of time. The TigerGraph default lifetime for a token is 1 month.

=== *Using Tokens*

Once REST{pp} authentication is enabled, a valid token should always be included in the HTTP header. If you are using curl to format and submit your REST{pp} requests, then use the following syntax:

.curl GSQL request, with authorization token in header

[source,console]
----
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" '<request_URL>'
----

Here is a sample request:

[source,console]
----
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer 01234567abcdefgh01234567abcdefgh" "http://localhost:9000/graph/socialNet/vertices/User?limit=3"
----

=== 3rd party JWT token

Since 3.10.0, TigerGraph now supports the use of 3rd party JWT token. See xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:jwt-token.adoc[] for more details.

== GSQL Server Requests

All requests made to the GSQL Server must be accompanied by your user credentials. You can use the `curl -u` option to pass in the username and password of the TigerGraph user:

[source,console]
----
curl -X GET -u <username>:<password> "http://localhost:14240/<path_to_endpoint>
----

To keep your credentials more secure, one way to avoid having the user name and password on the command line is to instead use a https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc[.netrc file] or a https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/configfile[config file]. If you are in interactive mode, you can also use the `-u` option without specifying the password, and then curl will prompt for the password.
