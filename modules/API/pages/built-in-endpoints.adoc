= Built-in Endpoints
:pp: {plus}{plus}
:description: All built-in REST API endpoints in TigerGraph server.

== System Utilities

=== Echo

`GET /echo` and `POST /echo`

These endpoints are simple diagnostic utilities, which respond with the following message if the RESTPP server is up and running.

==== Sample request:

.GET echo/ Request and Response

[source,console]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/echo"
{
    "error": false,
    "message": "Hello GSQL"
}
----



`POST /echo` has the same response as `GET /echo`.

==== Parameters

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `sleep`
| No
| Integer that indicates the number of seconds for which the response will be delayed.
|===

=== Health check (public)

This endpoint performs a simple server health check. It listens on port 14240 and does not require authentication. If you ping it and the server is running, it will respond with the message "pong".

==== Endpoint:

`GET /api/ping`

==== Sample request:

[source,text]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:14240/api/ping'
​
{
  "error": "false",
  "message": "pong",
  "results": {}
}
----

==== Parameters:

No parameters.

=== List all endpoints

`+GET /endpoints/{graph_name}+`

This endpoint returns a list of the installed endpoints and their parameters. There are three types of endpoints:

* _Built-in endpoints_ which are preinstalled in the TigerGraph system
* _Dynamic endpoints_ which are generated when compiling GSQL queries
* _Static endpoints_ which are user-installed endpoints

To include one or more of the endpoint types in the output, include the endpoint type in the parameter query string and set its value to `true`. If no type parameters are provided, all endpoints are returned.

.Example: Report on all built-in endpoints

[source,console]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/endpoints?builtin=true" | jq .
----



==== Response

There are over a dozen built-in endpoints, and some have several parameters, so the formatted JSON output of all built-in endpoints is over 300 lines long. It is listed in full in Appendix A. Below is a small excerpt of the output:

==== Parameters

This endpoint does not take any parameters.

=== Monitor system metrics

`GET /ts3/api/datapoints:14240`

TigerGraph System State Service (TS3) is TigerGraph's managed monitoring service that collects system metrics and events.
Many TigerGraph components report metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network traffic to TS3 at regular intervals.
This endpoint listens on port 14240 instead of port 9000.

You can use this endpoint to read from TS3. You can filter for the data points you need as follows:

* time: `when`, `from`, and `to`
* component: `who`
* metric: `what`
* location: `where`

Visualization of such metrics are available in Admin Portal - Dashboard - xref:gui:admin-portal:dashboard.adoc[Cluster Monitoring].

On a TigerGraph cluster, this endpoint is only present on the `m1` node.

==== Parameters
[width="100%",cols="12%,10%,78%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required |Description
|`+from+` |No |Epoch timestamp that indicates the start of the time
filter. Only data points reported after the timestamp will be included
in the return results.

|`+to+` |No |Epoch timestamp that indicates the end of the time filter.
Only data points reported before the timestamp will be included in the
return results.

|`+latest+` |No |Number of latest data points to return. If provided,
the endpoint will return the latest data points that satisfy the
`+what+`, `+who+` and `+where+` filters and ignore other time-related
filters.

|`+what+` |No a|Name of the metric to filter for. Possible values are:

* `+cpu+`: Percentage of CPU usage by component
* `+mem+`: Memory usage in megabytes by component
* `+diskspace+`: Disk usage in megabytes by
directory
* `+network+`: Network traffic in bytes since the service
started
* `+qps+`: Number of requests per second by
endpoint
* `+servicestate+`: Whether or not the service is online. A value of `+0+` indicates that the service is offline while a value of `+1+` means the service is online`+connection+`: Number of open TCP connections.

|`+who+` |No |Name of the component that reported the datapoint

|`+where+` |No |Name of the node that the datapoint is reported for
|===

==== Sample requests

In the sample request below, the filters in the query string include a timeframe starting at `1618957536` and ending at `1619023346`, and specifying that the response should only include CPU information:

=== Show query performance

`+GET /statistics/{graph_name}+`

This endpoint returns real-time query performance statistics over the given time period, as specified by the `seconds` __**__parameter. The `seconds` parameter must be a positive integer less than or equal to 60.

==== Sample request:

The return object is a hash of the endpoints and their performance data:

[source,console]

      10,
      10,
      10,
      200
    ]
  }
}
----

Each endpoint has the following attributes:

* `CompletedRequests` - the number of completed requests.
* `QPS` - query per second.
* `TimeoutRequests` - the number of requests not returning before the system-configured timeout limit. Timeout requests are not included in the calculation of QPS.
* `AverageLatency` - the average latency of completed requests.
* `MaxLatency` - the maximum latency of completed requests.
* `MinLatency` - the minimum latency of completed requests.
* `LatencyPercentile` - The latency distribution. The number of elements in this array depends on the `segments` ****parameter of this endpoint whose default value is 10, meaning the percentile range 0-100% will be divided into ten equal segments: 0%-10%, 11%-20%, etc.`Segments` ****must be [1, 100].

If there is no query sent in the past given seconds, an empty json will be returned.

==== Parameters

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `seconds`
| Yes
| Positive integer less than 60 that indicates how many seconds back from the current time the statistics report will cover.

| `segments`
| No
| Integer that indicates the number of segments that `LatencyPercentile` array in the response will be split into. The value for this endpoint must be between 1 and 100 and has a default value of 10.
|===

=== Rebuild graph engine

`+GET /rebuildnow/{graph_name}+` or `+POST /rebuildnow/{graph_name}+`

In TigerGraph, when new data is being loaded into the graph (such as new vertices or edges), data is first stored in memory before it is saved to disk permanently. TigerGraph runs a rebuild of the Graph Processing Engine (GPE) to commit the data in memory to disk every 30 seconds, but you can also call this endpoint to trigger a rebuild immediately.

==== Parameters

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required |Description
|`+threadnum+` |No |Number of threads used to execute the rebuild. If
not specified, the number specified in line 185 of the `+.tg.cfg+` file
(`+"RebuildThreadNumber"+`) in the home directory of the server on which
TigerGraph is running will be used; it is set to 3 by default. The
maximum value for this parameter is the number of vCPUs per node in your
distributed system. If you are running a single-node server, the maximum
is the number of vCPUs on that node. You can run `+lscpu+` in the
command line of your Linux server and look in the `+CPU(s)+` column to
view the number of vCPUs.

|`+vertextype+` |No |Vertex type to perform the rebuild for. If not provided, the rebuild will be run for all the vertex types.

|`+segid+` |No |Segment ID of the segments to rebuild. If not provided, all segments will be rebuilt. In general, it is recommended not to provide this parameter and rebuild all segments.

|`+path+` |No |Path to save the summary of the rebuild to. If not provided, the default path is `+/tmp/rebuildnow+`

|`+force+` |No |Boolean value that indicates whether to perform rebuilds for segments for which there are no records of new data. Normally, a rebuild would skip such segments, but if `+force+` is set true, the
segments will not be skipped.

=== Check deleted vertices

[.line-through]#`GET /deleted_vertex_check`#

In certain rare cases, TigerGraph's Graph Processing Engine (GPE) and Graph Storage Engine (GSE) might be out of sync on vertex deletion information. When this happens, some vertices might exist on one of the components, but not the other. Even though these errors are exceedingly rare, TigerGraph provides an endpoint that allows you to check the deleted vertices on GSE and GPE and see if they out of sync.

The check passes if there are no discrepancies between the GSE and GPE in terms of deleted vertices. If there is a discrepancy, the check fails and the return result will contain the IDs of the deleted vertices that are not synced properly. If you are running TigerGraph on a distributed cluster, the check will be performed on each node of the cluster, and the endpoint will return a list containing the results of the check for every node.

==== Parameters
[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required |Description
|`threadnum` |No |Integer that indicates the number of threads used to
execute the deleted vertex check jobs. This parameter is optional and
the default value is 6 if none is provided

|`segid` |No |IDs of segments to perform the deleted vertex check for.
If none is provided, the check will be performed on all segments.

|`vertextype` |No |Vertex types to perform the deleted vertex check for.
If none is provided, the check will be performed on all vertex types.

|`verbose` |No |Integer that indicates the level of detail in the return
results. Here is a list of accepted values and their corresponding level
of detail:`0` (default) : Only return whether the check passed and the
list of unsynced vertex IDs`1`: In addition to the previous level, also
return vertex count information `2`: In addition to the previous level,
return vertex count information for every segment`4`: In addition to the
previous level, also return the IDs of deleted vertices for every
segment

|`log` |No |Integer that indicates the log level of the deleted vertex
check. This log is not returned in the endpoint’s HTTP response, but is
printed to the logs of the GPE component at
`/tigergraph/log/gpe/log.INFO`:`0` (default): Report brief log for the
check as a whole`1`: Report logs for each segment`2`: Report additional
logs on the obtained deleted ID list

== Authentication

The endpoints in this subsection allow users to create, refresh and delete authentication tokens for requests made to the REST{pp} server. *These endpoints only exist when* xref:user-access:enabling-user-authentication.adoc[*user authentication is enabled*] *on RESTPP endpoints.*

=== Request a token (`GET`)

`GET /requesttoken`

If authentication is enabled on RESTPP endpoints, a token needs to be included in the request header for all requests sent to the RESTPP server. A user can generate a token using either

* A secret, which is a random string generated in GSQL (see xref:user-access:managing-credentials.adoc[Managing User Privileges and Authentication])
* Their username and password in their request header as well as specifying the graph

==== Sample request:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/requesttoken?secret=jiokmfqqfu2f95qs6ug85o89rpkneib3&lifetime=1000000"
{
  "code": "REST-0000",
  "expiration": 1616042814,
  "error": false,
  "message": "Generate new token successfully.",
  "token": "tohvf6khjqju8jf0r0l1cohhlm8gi5fq"
}

curl --user example_username:example_password -X GET "localhost:9000/requesttoken?graph=example_graph"
----

==== Parameters:

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `secret`
| Yes if `graph` is not supplied
| User's secret to generate the token.

| `lifetime`
| No
| Period of time for which the token is valid measured in seconds. The default value is about 2.6 million (about a month).

| `graph`
| Yes if `secret` is not supplied
| Name of the graph that the token will be valid for.
|===

Users can use either `secret` or their username and password to generate a token. If the user does not supply a secret and chooses to use their username and password instead, then the parameter `graph` becomes required.

=== Request a token (`POST`)

`POST /requesttoken`

You may also use a `POST` request to generate your token. This allows you to avoid exposing your secret in the query string.

==== Sample request:

[source,bash]
----
curl -d <path_to_secret> -X POST \
"http://localhost:9000/requesttoken?lifetime=1000000"
{
  "code": "REST-0000",
  "expiration": 0,
  "error": false,
  "message": "Refresh token successfully.",
  "token": "tohvf6khjqju8jf0r0l1cohhlm8gi5fq"
}
----

Replace `path_to_secret` with the path to the file containing your secret. The file should only include a single line, which is your secret.

==== Parameters:

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `lifetime`
| No
| Period of time for which the token is valid measured in seconds. The default value is about 2.6 million (about a month).
|===

=== Refresh a token

`PUT /requesttoken`

This endpoint takes a token and its associated secret and refreshes the lifetime of the token. The token itself remains unchanged.

*Parameters:*

|===
| *Name* | Required | Description

| `token`
| Yes
| Token to refresh.

| `secret`
| Yes
| User's secret used to generate the token.

| `lifetime`
| Yes
| Period of time for which the token is valid measured in seconds.
|===

==== Sample request

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9000/requesttoken?lifetime=15&secret=ksdoilrvpl0r0tef3d4abbpgu0t2u5la&token=0mq98l9pderkaivndf820gudg923p3l0"|jq .
{
  "code": "REST-0000",
  "expiration": 15,
  "error": false,
  "message": "Refresh token successfully.",
  "token": "0mq98l9pderkaivndf820gudg923p3l0"
}
----

[CAUTION]
====
*Known bug*: The output shows the lifetime instead of the expiration time.
====

=== Delete a token

`DELETE /requesttoken`

This endpoint takes a token and its associated secret, and deletes the token.

==== Parameters:

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `token`
| Yes
| Token to delete.

| `secret`
| Yes
| User's secret used to generate the token.
|===

== Loading jobs

=== Run a Loading Job

`+POST /ddl/{graph_name}+`

This endpoint is for loading data into a graph. It submits data as an HTTP request payload, to be loaded into the graph by the DDL Loader. The data payload can be formatted as generic CSV or JSON. For more details, please see xref:3.2@gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:system-and-language-basics.adoc[GSQL Language Reference Part 1 - Defining Graphs and Loading Data].

If the loading job references multiple files, multiple HTTP requests are needed to complete the loading job since you can only provide data for one filename varibale at a time. The loading job will skip the `LOAD` statements referencing filename variables that the request didn't provide data for.  To provide data for a filename variable, put the data in the request body and use the `filename` parameter (explained in the parameter table below) to match the variable name defined in the loading job.

==== Request body:

The request body is the data to be loaded (either in CSV or JSON format).

Curl allows you to read the data from an input file by using the @ symbol:

`curl -X POST --data-binary @./company.csv "http://…"`

==== Sample request:

In this example, the loading job is dependent on three filename variables (`f1` and `f3`) and one filepath string. Therefore, three HTTP requests are needed to complete the loading job.

[source,bash]
----
# Loading job

    LOAD f3 to EDGE work_at VALUES ($0, $1, $3, $4, $5);
}

# Provide data for for the second LOAD statement

----

==== Parameters:

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `tag`
| Yes
| Loading job name defined in your DDL loading job

| `filename`
| Yes
| File variable name or file path for the file containing the data

| `sep`
| No
| Separator of CSV data. If your data is JSON, you do not need to specify this parameter. The default separator is a comma``","``

| `eol`
| No
| End-of-line character. Only one or two characters are allowed, except for the special case "\r\n". The default value is `"\n"`

| `ack`
| No
| `"all"`: request will return after all GPE instances have acknowledged the `POST` request. `"none"`: request will return immediately after RESTPP processed the `POST` request.

| `timeout`
| No
| Timeout in seconds. If set to 0, use system-wide endpoint timeout setting.

| `concise`
| No
| Boolean value that indicates whether to return concise results of the data loading request. Concise results will only include the number of vertices and edges added or deleted, and will omit information such as the number of valid and invalid lines in the default response.
|===

If there are special characters in your parameter values, the special characters should use https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp[URL encoding]. To avoid confusion about whether you should you one or two backslashes, we do not support backslash escapes for the `eol` or `sep` parameter.

The maximum size of data you can upload via this endpoint is controlled by the xref:API:intro.adoc#_request_body_size[`Nginx.ClientMaxBodySize`] configuration parameter (default is 200 MB).

=== Upsert data to graph

`+POST /graph/{graph_name}+`

This endpoint upserts vertices and/or edges into a graph. To upsert means that if a vertex or edge does not exist, it is inserted, and if it does exist, it is updated.

==== Atomic upsert transaction

By default, the `+POST /graph/{graph_name}+` endpoint is not atomic. If something goes wrong during the process of the request,  the request data can be partially consumed by the database.

You can append a query string parameter `atomic_post` to the URL of the request and set its value to true to make the request an atomic transaction, which means that updates to the database contained in the request are all-or-nothing. Either all changes are successful, or none is successful.

For example, suppose we have the following request to upsert two vertices:

[source,text]
----
curl --data-binary @vertices.json http://localhost:9000/graph/social
----

And the content of `vertices.json` is:

[source,text]
----
{
 "vertices": {
    "person": {
      "Velma": {
        "age": {
           "value": 30
         }
      },
      "Kelly": {
        "age": {
           "value": 22
         }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

With the request above, if the vertex `Kelly` fails to be upserted due to a machine failure, it is still possible that the vertex `Velma` is upserted to the database.

If you add the `atomic_post` parameter to the request URL and set its value to true, the request becomes atomic and if any part of the request body fails to be upserted, nothing will be upserted:

[source,bash]
----
# This is an atomic request
curl --data-binary @vertices.json http://localhost:9000/graph/social?automic_post=true
----

==== Parameters
[width="100%",cols="23%,9%,68%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required |Description
|`ack` |No |The value of this parameter can either be `"all"` or
`"none"`. `"all"`: request will return after all GPE instances have
acknowledged the POST `"none"`: request will return immediately after
RESTPP processed the POST.
Default value is false.

|`new_vertex_only` |No |If `new_vertex_only` is set to true, the request will only insert new
vertices and not update existing ones.
Default value is false.

|`vertex_must_exist` |No |If `vertex_must_exist` true, the request will only insert an *edge* if both the `FROM` and
`TO` vertices of the edge already exist.
If the value is false, the request will always insert new edges, and create the necessary vertices with default values for their attributes.
Note that this parameter does not affect vertices.
Default value is false.

|`update_vertex_only`|No |If `update_vertex_only` is set to true, the request will only update existing vertices and not insert new vertices.

|`atomic_post`|No |If `atomic_post` is set to true, the request becomes an atomic transaction - either all updates are successful or no updates are successful.
Default value is false.
|===

The response is the number of vertices and edges that were accepted. The API uses JSON format to describe the vertices and edges to be upserted.
The JSON code can be stored in a text file or specified directly in a command line.
There is a maximum size for a `POST` data payload (see the xref:API:intro.adoc#_size_and_time_limits[*Size Limits*] section).
The JSON format for describing a vertex set or edge set is summarized below.

==== Request body

The payload data should be in JSON according to the schema shown below:

                      "<attribute>": {
                         "value": <value>,
                         "op": <opcode>
                      }
                   }
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
}
----
The fields in angle brackets (`<>`) are placeholder names or values, to be replaced with actual values.
The keys in angle brackets, such as `<vertex_type>`, can be repeated to form a list of items.
The keys which are not in angle brackets are exact texts that must be used as they are.
The nested hierarchy means that vertices are grouped by type.
Edges, on the other hand, are first grouped by source vertex type, then vertex ID, then edge type.
====

The first example below shows two `User` vertices having an attribute called `age`:

.Upsert Example Data 1: Two User vertices
[source,json]
----
{
  "vertices": {
    "User": {
      "id6": {
        "age": {
           "value": 30
         }
      },
      "id1": {
        "age": {
           "value": 22
         }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The second example starts with one `User` vertex.
Since `id6` contains no attributes, it will remain the same it if already exists.
If it doesn't yet exist, the request will create a vertex with ID `id6` with default attribute values.
Then two edges are created: a `Liked` edge from `id1` to `id6`, and then a `Liked_By` edge from `id6` to `id1`.

Follow the instructions in the Introduction section to xref:API:intro.adoc#_formatting_data_in_json[format advanced data types].

For example, the following payload is used to upsert two `User` vertices with an attribute `coordinates` of type `LIST` and an attribute `measurements` of type `MAP`:

[source,bash]
----
{
 "vertices": {
    "User": {
      "id4": {
        "coordinates": {
           "value": [51.3345, -7.2233]
         },
        "measurements": {
           "value": {
             "keyList": ["chest", "waist", "hip"]
             "valueList": [35, 30, 35]
           }
         }
      },
      "id5": {
        "coordinates": {
           "value": [31.3245, -17.3292]
         },
        "measurements": {
           "value": {
             "keyList": ["chest", "waist", "hip"]
             "valueList": [39, 35, 41]
           }
         }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

==== Operation codes

Each attribute value may be accompanied by an operation (op) code, which provides very sophisticated schemes for data update or insertion:

|===
| Type | op | Meaning

| 1
| `"ignore_if_exists"` or `"~"`
| If the vertex/edge does not exist, use the payload value to initialize the attribute; but if the vertex/edge already exists, do not change this attribute.

| 2
| `"add"` or `"+"`
| Add the payload value to the existing value.

| 3
| `"and"` or `"&"`
| Update to the logical AND of the payload value and the existing value.

| 4
| `"or"` or `"\|"`
| Update to the logical OR of the payload value and the existing value.

| 5
| `"max"` or `">"`
| Update to the higher value between the payload value and the existing value.

| 6
| `"min"` or `"<"`
| Update to the lower value between the payload value and the existing value.
|===

If an attribute is not given in the payload, the attribute stays unchanged if the vertex/edge already exists, or if the vertex/edge does not exist, a new vertex/edge is created and assigned the default value for that data type. The default value is 0 for `int/uint`, 0.0 for `float/double`, and `""`(empty string) for string.

==== Invalid data types cause the request to be rejected

The RESTPP server validates the request before updating the values. The following schema violations will cause the entire request to fail and no change will be made to a graph:

* For vertex upsert
 ** Invalid vertex type
 ** Invalid attribute data type
* For edge upsert:
 ** Invalid source vertex type
 ** Invalid edge type
 ** Invalid target vertex type
 ** Invalid attribute data type.

If an invalid attribute name is given, it is ignored.

==== Output response

The response is the number of vertices and edges that were accepted. Additionally, if `new_vertex_only` is true, the response will include two more fields:

* `skipped_vertices`: the number of vertices in the input data which already existed in the graph
* `vertices_already_exist`: the id and type of the input vertices which were skipped

If `vertex_must_exist` is true, the response will include two more fields:

* `skipped_edges`: the number of edges in the input data rejected because of missing endpoint vertices
* `miss_vertices`: the id and type of the endpoint vertices which were missing

The example file `add_id6.json` (shown in the *Request Body* section) upserts one `User` __vertex with `id = "id6"`, one `Liked` __edge, and one `Liked_By` __edge. The `Liked` __edge is from `"id1` " to `"id6"`; the `Liked_By` __edge is from `"id6"` to _``"id1"``_.

==== Example

The following example submits an upsert request by using the payload data stored in `add_id6.json`.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST --data-binary @add_id6.json \
"http://localhost:9000/graph"

{"accepted_vertices":1,"accepted_edges":2}
----

If we set the value of `vertex_must_exist` parameter to `true`, the endpoint will only insert edges whose endpoint vertices both exist. This includes the vertices being inserted in the same request.
Therefore, inserting the content of `add_id6.json` to an empty graph would cause the edges to be rejected:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST --data-binary @add_id6.json \
"http://localhost:9000/graph?vertex_must_exist=true"

{
  "version": {
    "edition": "enterprise",
    "api": "v2",
    "schema": 0
  },
  "error": false,
  "message": "",
  "results": [
    {
      "accepted_vertices": 1,
      "accepted_edges": 0,
      "skipped_edges": 2,
      "edge_vertices_not_exist": [
        {
          "v_type": "User",
          "v_id": "id1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "code": "REST-0003"
}

==== Parameters

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `count_only`
| No
| Takes a boolean value. If the value is true, the `results` field will only contain the count of how many vertices were selected. Default is `false`.

| `select`
| No
| Attributes of the selected vertices to return. The parameter takes a list, which is a string of comma-separated values, and will only return the attributes that are provided.

| `filter`
| No
| Conditions used to filter the returned vertices. The parameter takes a list of conditions, which is a string of comma-separated values. If any filter conditions are provided, the endpoint will only return the vertices that satisfy the conditions. Six comparison operators are supported for this parameter: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` and `+<=+`. If the value on the right side of an operator is a string literal, it should be enclosed in double-quotes.

| `limit`
| No
| Integer value that specifies the total number of vertices to return

| `sort`

The response object will contain a `"deleted_vertices"` field that indicates the number of vertices that were deleted

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9000/graph/socialNet/vertices/User"

{
  "version": {
    "edition": "enterprise",
    "api": "v2",
    "schema": 0

  }
}
----

==== Parameters
[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required |Description
|`permanent` |No |Takes a boolean value. If the value is true, the
deleted vertex IDs can never be inserted back, unless the graph is
dropped or the graph store is cleared.

|`filter` |No |Conditions used to filter the vertices to delete. The
parameter takes a list of conditions, which is a string of
comma-separated values. If any filter conditions are provided, the
endpoint will only delete the vertices that satisfy the conditions. Six
comparison operators are supported for this parameter: `=`, `!=`, `>`,
`>=`, `<` and `<=`. If the value on the right side of an operator is a
string literal, it should be enclosed in double-quotes.

|`limit` |No |Integer value that specifies the total number of vertices
to delete.

|`sort` |No |Attributes to sort the vertices by. In delete
operations,`sort` should always be used together with `limit`. The
endpoint will delete the number of vertices under the limit specified in
the order specified. The parameter takes a list of attributes, and the
endpoint will sort all vertices based on the attributes provided in the
list in order. Add `"-"` in front of the attribute to sort by that
attribute in descending order.

|`timeout` |No |Integer that specifies the number of seconds after which
the query will time out. If the parameter is set to 0 or isn’t provided,
the system-wide endpoint timeout setting is applied.

The JSON response object contains three fields:

* *`queryname`*: name of the query, same as the query input parameter.
* *`input`*: unordered list of the input parameter names and data types.
* *`output`*: JSON object that follows the same structure of the query's output. For each key-value pair, the key is the name that appears in the query output, while the values are the data types of the output.

==== Parameters:

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `graph`
| Yes
| Name of the graph

| `query`
| Yes
| Name of the query
|===

=== Run an installed query (`GET`)

`+GET /query/{graph_name}/{query_name}+`

Each time a new TigerGraph query is installed, a dynamic endpoint is generated. This new endpoint enables the user to run the new TigerGraph query through HTTP requests and giving the parameters in URL or in a data payload. In the case of a `GET` request, parameters should be passed in through the query string.

==== Parameters

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `read_committed`
| No
| Boolean value that indicates whether to use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Read_committed[read-committed isolation level] for the query. At the read committed level, it is guaranteed that any data read is committed at the moment it is read. By default, it is off.
|===

==== Query parameter passing

When using a `GET` request to run an installed query, the query parameters are xref:API:intro.adoc#_query_string_parameters[passed in through the query string of the URL].
[width="100%",cols="28%,36%,36%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter type |Query string format |Example
|Set or bag of primitives |Assign multiple values to the same parameter
name. |A set `p1` of integers: `**p1=1&p1=5&p1=10**`

|`VERTEX<type>` |Use the ID of the vertex:`parameterName=vertex_id` |A
vertex with parameter name `vp` and an ID of person2: `**vp=person2**`

|`VERTEX`(type not pre-specified) |Use two query string
parameters**:**`parameterName=vertex_id\'\'parameterName.type=vertex_type`
|A vertex with parameter name `va` , type `person` and and ID
`person1`:`va=person1&va.type=person`

|Set or bag of `VERTEX<type>` |Assign multiple vertex IDs to the same
`SET` or `BAG` parameter name. |A set parameter named `vp` of vertices
of type person:`vp=person3&vp=person4`

|Set or bag of `VERTEX`(type not pre-specified) |The `SET` or `BAG` must
be treated as an array. A vertex ID and type must be provided for the
vertex element at each index. |A set parameter named `vp` of
vertices:`vp[0]=person1&vp[0].type=person&vp[1]=11&vp[1].type=post`
|===

==== Specify replica

If you have a TigerGraph HA cluster, you can specify a query to run on a particular replica with the HTTP header `GSQL-REPLICA`. The value of the header needs to be an integer within the range one to the replication factor of the cluster. If you supply a invalid value for the header, the request will return an error.

==== Specify thread limit

When running a query through RESTPP, you can specify a limit on the number of threads that the query is allowed to use on each node through the HTTP header `GSQL-THREAD-LIMIT`. The number of threads used by a query means the number of vCPUs used by the query. By default, a query will use all threads that are available on a machine.

For example, if you have a cluster of three nodes, each with 8 vCPUs, then a query will use all 8 threads available on a node in the cluster by default. By providing a thread limit in the request header, you can limit the query to only use a number of threads under the limit.

==== Sample request:

To run query `hello` on a graph named `social`, and the query parameter is of type `VERTEX<person>` whose ID is `"Tom"`

.Running a query via HTTP request

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello?p=Tom"

# Limiting the query to use under 4 threads
curl -x GET -H "GSQL-THREAD-LIMIT: 4" "http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello?p=Tom"

# Specifying the query to run on the first replica
curl -X GET -H "GSQL-REPLICA: 2" "http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello?p=Tom"

# Specifying the query to run on the primary cluster
curl -X GET -H "GSQL-REPLICA: 1" "http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello?p=Tom"
----



=== Run an installed query (`POST`)

`+POST /query/{graph_name}/{query_name}+`

Users can also run queries through a `POST` request, which allows them to pass query parameters in JSON. This is especially helpful when the query takes complex parameters.

==== Parameters

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `read_committed`
| No
| Boolean value that indicates whether to use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Read_committed[read-committed isolation level] for the query. At the read committed level, it is guaranteed that any data read is committed at the moment it is read. By default, it is off.
|===

==== Query parameter Passing

When using a `POST` request to run an installed query, the query parameters are passed in through the request body and xref:API:intro.adoc#_formatting_data_in_json[encoded in JSON format]. The formatting rules for the JSON payload is the same as xref:3.2@gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc#_parameter_json_object[using JSON to pass in parameters in the `RUN QUERY` command].

[width="99%",cols="28%,36%,36%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter type |Syntax |Example
|`DATETIME` |Use a string formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS"`
|`"2019-02-19 19:19:19"`

|Set or bag of primitives |Use a JSON array containing the primitive
values |`["a", "list", "of", "args"]`

|`VERTEX<type>` |Use a JSON object containing a field `"id"` for the
vertex ID and a field `"type"` for the type of the vertex
|`{"id": "person1",\'\'"type": "person"}`

|`VERTEX` (type not specified) |Use a JSON object containing a field
`"id"` for the vertex ID |`{"id": "person1"}`

|Set or bag of `VERTEX<type>` |Use a JSON array containing a list of
JSON `VERTEX<type>` object |`[{"id": "person1"}, {"id": "person2"}]`

|Set or bag of vertices of unspecified types |Use a JSON array
containing a list of JSON `VERTEX`
|`[{"id": "person1",\'\'"type": "person"},{"id": "person2",\'\'"type": "person"}]`
|===

==== Specify replica

If you have a TigerGraph HA cluster, you can specify a query to run on a particular replica with the HTTP header `GSQL-REPLICA`. The value of the header needs to be an integer within the range one to the replication factor of the cluster. If you supply an invalid value for the header, the request will return an error.

==== Specify thread limit

When running a query through RESTPP,  you can specify a limit on the number of threads that the query is allowed to use on each node through the HTTP header `GSQL-THREAD-LIMIT`. The number of threads used by a query means the number of vCPUs used by the query. By default, a query will use all threads that are available on a machine.

For example, if you have a cluster of three nodes, each with 8 vCPUs, then a query will use all 8 threads available on a node in the cluster by default. By providing a thread limit in the request header, you can limit the query to only use a number of threads under the limit.

==== Sample request

The query in this sample request takes a parameter of type `VERTEX<person>`:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST -d '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}' \
"http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello"

# Specify that the query run on the first replica
curl -X POST -d -H "GSQL-REPLICA: 2" '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}' \
"http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello"

# Specify that the query run on the primary cluster
curl -X POST -d -H "GSQL-REPLICA: 1" '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}' \
"http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello"

# Specify that the query run on
curl -X POST -d -H "GSQL-THREAD-LIMIT: 4" '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}' \
"http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello"
----

[NOTE]
====
Installed queries can run in xref:gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc#_detached_mode_async_option[Detached Mode]. To do this, use the ``GSQL-ASYNC``header and set its value to `true`. The xref:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_check_query_status_detached_mode[results] and link:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_check_query_status_detached_mode[status] of the queries run in Detached Mode can be retrieved with a query ID, which is returned immediately when queries are executed in Detached Mode.
====

=== Run an interpreted query

`POST /gsqlserver/interpreted_query`

This endpoint runs a GSQL query in Interpreted Mode. The query body should be supplied at the data payload, and the query's parameters are supplied as the URL's query string. *This endpoint exists on the GSQL server on port 14240.*

This request goes directly to the GSQL server (port 14240) instead of the RESTPP server (port 9000), so the username and password must be specified in the header. If you are using curl, you can use the `-u` option as shown below.

==== Request body:

The request body for this endpoint should be the entire `INTERPRET QUERY` statement.

==== Parameter passing:

When running an interpreted query through this endpoint, the query parameters should be xref:intro.adoc#_query_string_parameters[passed in through the URL query string].

==== Sample request:

[source,javascript]
----
curl --fail -u <my_username>:<my_password> -X POST \
"http://localhost:14240/gsqlserver/interpreted_query?a=10" \

== Path-Finding Algorithms

The TigerGraph platform comes with two built-in endpoints, `/shortestpath` and `/allpaths`, which return either the shortest or all unweighted paths connecting a set of source vertices to a set of target vertices. The table below summarizes the two path-finding endpoints.

=== Input Parameters and Output Format for Path-Finding

Each REST endpoint reads a JSON-formatted payload that describes the input parameters. These parameters specify which vertices and edges may be on the paths, additional conditions on the attributes of the vertices and edges, and the maximum length of a path.

==== Source and target vertices

Each endpoint must have either a *source* or *sources* key and either a *target* or *targets* parameter. The source and target parameters describe a single vertex. The format for a vertex object is as follows: `{"type" : "<vertex_type_name>", "id" : "<vertex_id>"}.`  The sources and targets parameters are JSON arrays containing a list of vertex objects.

*Filters* +
The payload may also have an array of filter conditions, to restrict the vertices or edges in the paths. Each individual filter is a JSON object which describes a condition on one vertex type or edge type.  A filter object has one or two key-value pairs: `{"type": "<vertex_or_edge_type>", "condition": "<attribute_condition>"}`

* `"type":` the vertex type or edge type to be filtered
* `"condition"` (optional): a boolean expression on one attribute of the given vertex type or edge type. "AND" and "OR" may be used to make compound expressions.

Example of a filter array:

[source,markup]
----
[{"type": "bought", "condition": "price < \"100\" and quality == \"good\""},
 {"type": "sold",   "condition": "price > \"100\"  or quality != \"good\""}]
----

Note that all filtering conditions in *`vertexFilters`* and *`edgeFilters`* are combined with the `"OR"`  relationship, i.e., if a vertex (or edge) fulfills any one of the filter conditions, then this vertex (or edge) will be included in the resulting paths.

==== Output

The JSON output is a list of vertices and a list of edges. Each vertex and each edge is listed in full, with all attributes.  The collections of vertices and edges are not in path order.

=== Find shortest path

`+POST /shortestpath/{graph_name}+`

This endpoint takes a source vertex or a set of source vertices, a target vertex or a set of target vertices, and returns the shortest path between the source and the target. If the source is a set of vertices, the resulting path will begin with one of the vertices in the set. If the target is a set of vertices, the resulting path will end with one of the vertices in the set.

==== Request body:

This endpoint expects a request body that describes the source and target vertex or vertex set. Below is a table of all the fields in the request body.

|===
| Key | Type | Description

| `source`
| vertex object
| Each path must start from this vertex. Mutually exclusive with `sources`.

| `sources`
| vertex array
| Each path must start from one of these vertices. Mutually exclusive with `source`.

| `target`
| vertex object
| Each path must end at this vertex. Mutually exclusive with `targets`.

| `targets`
| vertex array
| Each path must end at one of these vertices. Mutually exclusive with `target`.

| `vertexFilters`
| filter array
| (OPTIONAL) Restrict the paths to those whose vertices satisfy any of the given filters.

| `edgeFilters`
| filter array
| (OPTIONAL) Restrict the paths to those whose edges satisfy any of the given filters. See details of filters above.

| No
| Integer that specified the maximum length of a shortest path. The default value is 6.

| `allShortestPaths`
| No
| If *true*, the endpoint will return all shortest paths between the source and target. Default is *false*, meaning that the endpoint will return only one path.
|===

=== Find all paths

`+POST /allpaths/{graph_name}+`

This endpoint finds all paths between a source vertex (or vertex set) and target vertex (or vertex set).

==== Request body:

This endpoint expects a request body that describes the source and target vertex or vertex set. Below is a table of all the fields in the request body.

|===
| Key | Type | Description

| `source`
| vertex object
| Each path must start from this vertex. Mutually exclusive with `sources`.

| `sources`
| vertex array
| Each path must start from one of these vertices. Mutually exclusive with `source`.

| `edgeFilters`
| filter array
| (OPTIONAL) Restrict the paths to those whose edges satisfy any of the given filters. See details of filters above.
|===

==== Parameters:

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `maxLength`
| Yes
| Maximum path length.
|===

[WARNING]
====
The current implementation of this endpoint will include paths with loops. Since it is possible to go around a loop an infinite number of times, it is important that you select the smallest value of maxLength which you consider appropriate.  Even if there are no loops in your graph, a smaller maxLength will allow your query to run faster.
====

==== Sample request:

The example below requests all paths between the source vertex set {Video 0} and the target vertex set {AttributeTag "action"}, up to maximum length 3. The path may only contain Video vertices where `year >= 1984`. The result includes 3 paths: +
AttrributeTag "action"  --  Video 0 +
AttrributeTag "action"  --  Video 3 -- VidUser 4 -- Video 0 +
AttrributeTag "action"  --  Video 2 -- VidUser 0 -- Video 0
