= Querying

In TigerGraph, users query data using the GSQL Query Language. 
Unlike traditional query languages for relational databases, a GSQL query is designed to be a saved prodecure containing a series of declaration, data-manipulation, data-modification, and output statements. 

For an introduction to GSQL, see the link:https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/blob/master/demos/guru_scripts/docker/tutorial/4.x/README.md[GSQL V3 Tutorial].
