= Querying

In TigerGraph, users query data using the GSQL Query Language. 
Unlike traditional query languages for relational databases, a GSQL query is designed to be a saved prodecure containing a series of declaration, data-manipulation, data-modification, and output statements. 

To learn about the syntax and the statements available in the GSQL Query Language, see xref:gsql-ref:querying:index.adoc[GSQL Language Reference: Querying.]
