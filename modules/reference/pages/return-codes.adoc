= Return codes
:description: The reference page for status codes on the TigerGraph platform.
//:page-aliases: error-codes.adoc
:pp: {plus}{plus}

This page documents the _status codes_ and _exit codes_ on the TigerGraph platform. Each status code follows the format: `<component>-<code>` , while exit codes are numeric values between 0 - 255.

If the system was handling a user request, the status code and message will be in the JSON response (see xref:{page-component-version}@gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc#_gsql_query_output_format[GSQL Query Output Format] ). For internal errors, the error information may be in a log file.

The GSQL Client will exit with a non-zero code if there's an error while handling a user request. To view the exit code of the GSQL client, run the command `echo $?` and the exit code of the most recent command will be printed to the terminal.
