:description: List of all ports on TigerGraph.

This page lists all ports that TigerGraph uses.

TigerGraph requires three external ports to be exposed: 22, 9000, and 14240. All other ports are used for internal communication within a cluster and must be open within the cluster.

|===

Under ports for internal communication, they are also the *dynamic ports* (aka ephemeral ports) that are used for only a short period of time for the duration of a communication session.
Such short-lived ports are allocated automatically within a predefined range (in TigerGraph case from 49152 to 65535) of port numbers by the OS.
After completion of the session, the port is destroyed and the port number becomes available for reuse.
