=== Specify the data mapping
Next, we use LOAD statements to describe how the incoming data will be loaded to attributes of vertices and edges. Each LOAD statement handles the data mapping, and optional data transformation and filtering, from one filename to one or more vertex and edge types.

[source,gsql]
.LOAD statement syntax
----
LOAD [ source_object|filevar|TEMP_TABLE table_name ]
  destination_clause [, destination_clause ]*
  [ TAGS clause ] <1>
  [ USING clause ];
----
<1>  As of v3.9.3, TAGS are deprecated.

Let's break down one of the LOAD statements in our example:
[source,gsql]
.Example loading job for local files
----
LOAD file_Person TO VERTEX Person
    VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $0, $6, $7,
       SPLIT($8, ";"), SPLIT($9, ";"))
    USING SEPARATOR="|", HEADER="true", EOL="\n";
----
* `$0`, `$1`,...  refer to the first, second, ... columns in each line a data file.
* `SEPARATOR="|"` says the column separator character is the pipe (`|`). The default is comma (`,`).
* `HEADER="true"` says that the first line in the source contains column header names instead of data.  These names can be used instead of the columnn numbers.
* `SPLIT` is one of GSQL's ETL functions.  It says that there is a multi-valued column, which has a separator character to mark the subfields in that column.

Refer to xref:3.6@gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:creating-a-loading-job.adoc[] in the GSQL Language Reference for descriptions of all the options for loading jobs.
