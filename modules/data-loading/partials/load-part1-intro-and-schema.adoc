After you have xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:defining-a-graph-schema.adoc[defined a graph schema], you can create a loading job, specify your data sources, and run the job to load data.

The steps are similar whether you are loading from local files, from cloud storage, or any of the other supported sources.
We will call out whether a particular step is common for all loading or specific to a data source or loading mode.

== Example Schema
This example uses part of the LDBC_SNB schema:
