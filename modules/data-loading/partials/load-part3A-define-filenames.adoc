=== Define filenames
First we define _filenames_, which are local variables referring to data files (or data objects).

[NOTE]
The terms `FILENAME` and `filevar` are used for legacy reasons, but a `filevar` can also be an object in a data object store.

The file descriptor can be specified at compile time or at runtime.
Runtime settings override compile-time settings:
