== Manage and monitor your loading job

When a loading job starts, the GSQL server assigns it a job ID and displays it for the user to see.
There are four key commands to monitor and manage loading jobs:

[source,php]
----
SHOW LOADING STATUS job_id|ALL
ABORT LOADING JOB job_id|ALL
RESUME LOADING JOB job_id
SHOW LOADING ERROR job_id
----

`SHOW LOADING STATUS` shows the current status of either a specified loading job or all current jobs, this command should be within the scope of a graph:

[source,php]
GSQL > USE GRAPH graph_name
GSQL > SHOW LOADING STATUS ALL

For each loading job, the above command reports the following information:

* Loading status
* Loaded lines/Loaded objects/Error lines
* Average loading speed
* Size of loaded data
* Duration

When inspecting all current jobs with `SHOW LOADING STATUS ALL`, the jobs in the `FINISHED` state will be omitted as they are considered to have successfully finished.
You can use `SHOW LOADING STATUS job_id` to check the historical information of finished jobs.
If the report for this job contains error data, you can use `SHOW LOADING ERROR job_id` to see the original data that caused the error.

See xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:managing-loading-job.adoc[Managing and Inspecting a Loading Job] for more details.

== Manage loading job concurrency

See xref:loading-concurrency.adoc[Loading Job Concurrency] for how to manage the concurrency of loading jobs.
