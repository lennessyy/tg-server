== Create a loading job

A loading job tells the database how to construct vertices and edges from data sources. The loading job body has two parts:

. DEFINE statements create variables to refer to data sources.
These can refer to actual files or be placeholder names. The actual data sources can be given when running the loading job.

. LOAD statements specify how to take the data fields from files to construct vertices or edges.

CREATE LOADING JOB <job_name> FOR GRAPH <graph_name> {

The opening line does some naming:

* assigns a name to this job: (`<job_name>`)
* associates this job with a graph (`<graph_name>`)
