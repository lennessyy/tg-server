= The GSQL Shell
:description: Overview of the GSQL shell.
//:page-aliases: gsql-shell.adoc

The GSQL shell is a fully functional Java environment for interacting with the TigerGraph database. 
It is one of the primary ways to interact with the TigerGraph database and is included in a standard TigerGraph installation. 

To learn more about the GSQL language, follow our tutorial series starting with link:https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/blob/master/demos/guru_scripts/docker/tutorial/4.x/README.md[GSQL V3 Tutorial].

== Launch the shell
As the TigerGraph Linux user, type `gsql` into the bash terminal to start a GSQL shell session:

[source,console]
----
$ gsql
----

If authentication is enabled, you will need to provide credentials in order to launch the shell.

== Change scope
In the GSQL shell, you can run commands on a global scope or on a local scope.
When you start a GSQL session, you are in the global scope.
To change to the local scope of a graph, run the `USE GRAPH` command.

[source,GSQL]
----
GSQL > USE GRAPH social
Using graph 'social'
----

To switch back to the global scope, run `USE GLOBAL`.

[source,GSQL]
----
GSQL > USE GLOBAL
----

Operating on different scopes will require different privileges.
For more information, see Roles and Privileges.

== Multi-line commands
By default, GSQL treats each line as one command; the GSQL interpreter will activate as soon as the end-df-line character is entered.


[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > ls <1>
---- Global vertices, edges, and all graphs
Vertex Types:
  - VERTEX Person(PRIMARY_ID id STRING, name STRING, score FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL) WITH STATS="OUTDEGREE_BY_EDGETYPE"
  - DIRECTED EDGE Friend(FROM Person, TO Person, weight FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL) WITH REVERSE_EDGE="Also_Friend"
  - DIRECTED EDGE Also_Friend(FROM Person, TO Person, weight FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL) WITH REVERSE_EDGE="Friend"
  - UNDIRECTED EDGE Coworker(FROM Person, TO Person, weight FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL)

Graphs:
  - Graph social(Person:v, Friend:e, Also_Friend:e, Coworker:e)
Jobs:


JSON API version: v2
Syntax version: v1
GSQL > CREATE QUERY example () { <2>
Encountered "<EOF>" at line 1, column 25.
Was expecting:
    "}" ...
----
<1> GSQL executes a single-line command immediately after encountering the end-of-line character.
<2> Trying to enter a multi-line command in the default single-line mode will cause an error.


Multi-line mode allows the user to enter several lines of text without triggering immediate execution.
This is useful when a statement is very long and the user would like to split it into multiple lines.
It is also useful when defining a job or query, because they typically contain multiple statements.

To enter multi-line mode, use the command `BEGIN`.
The end-of-line character is now disabled from triggering execution.
The shell remains in multi-line mode until the command `END` or `ABORT` is entered.
The `END` command triggers the execution of the multi-line block. Alternately, the `ABORT` command exits multi-line mode and discards the multi-line block.

=== Example
In the example below, `BEGIN` and `END` are used to allow the SELECT statement to be split into several lines:

[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > BEGIN
GSQL > CREATE QUERY example () {
GSQL > PRINT "Hello world";
GSQL > }
GSQL > END
Successfully created queries: [example].
----

== Run GSQL scripts and in-line commands
You don't always need to enter the interactive shell in order to run a GSQL command.
You can also run command in-line or through a GSQL script.

To run a GSQL command non-interactively, run the bash command `gsql` followed by the GSQL commands you want to run in quotes:

[source,console]
----
$ gsql 'ls'
----

To run a GSQL script, put all your GSQL commands in a file (conventionally ending with the extension .gsql), and run:

[source,console]
----
$ gsql <filename>
----
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the script file.

You can also run a GSQL script from the GSQL shell. To do so, type in the file name prefixed with the `@` character:
[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > @<filename>
----
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the script file.
