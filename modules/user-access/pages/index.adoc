TigerGraph's user access management features are based on the role-based access control (RBAC) model, providing users with fine-grained access control.

//Authentication is "who are you"
//Authorization is "what can you do"
//
//
//
//~~~ Why can users override RBAC?
//
//~~~ this page should provide the three-axis overview of our access control concept.

WARNING: User authentication is not enabled by default.
To secure your database and the underlying system, we strongly suggest that you xref:enabling-user-authentication.adoc[enable authentication].
