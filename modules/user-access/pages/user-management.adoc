This page explains the procedures for various user management tasks under TigerGraph's role-based access control(RBAC) model.

To see user management tasks under the xref:access-control-model.adoc#_access_control_lists[Access Control List (ACL)] model, see xref:acl-management.adoc[].

== Create a user

You can run the `CREATE USER` command to create a user.

== Username Rules for v3.9.3 and above

NOTE: v3.9.3 expanded the variety of characters users can access while creating a username from previous versions.

IMPORTANT: A username is treated as a `STRING` in GSQL,
regardless of the syntax structure, format, or characters used.

*Usernames* may contain any Unicode characters *except* the following:

. May not contain these characters: `\r`, `\n`, `\0`, `\b`, `\t`, `\a`, `\v`.

. May not contain any `SPACE`.

NOTE: In the GSQL client, backquotes ( ``` ) must be used as a delimiter to enclose usernames which is not a valid email and does not follow the pattern [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*.
Delimiters are not stored internally.

== Username Rules for v3.9.2 and below

NOTE: For v3.9.2 and below please follow these guidelines when creating a username.

*Usernames* must match a regex pattern of `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*`, or be an email.
You may also use non-ascii characters, such as Chinese and Kanji characters.

Additionally, usernames may **not** contain the following characters:

. `\`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `:`, `<`, `>`, `;`, `,`, `@`, `\r`, `\n`, `\f`, `\t`, `\\`, `\0`, `\b`.

. A username may not start with a dot ( `.` ) or have multiple dots ( `...` or `a.b..c...` ) in a sequence.

NOTE: Backquotes ( ``` ) must be used as a delimiter to enclose usernames which do not follow
the pattern `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*`. Delimiters are not stored internally.

== View roles assignments and login attempts
The `SHOW USER` command displays the role assignments, as well as the login attempts,  of the current user.
If the current user has the `READ_USER` privilege

=== Syntax

[source,gsql]
----
SHOW USER
----

=== Required privilege

`READ_USER` for displaying roles of other users

=== Procedure

From the GSQL shell, run the `SHOW USER` command:

[source,gsql]

    - FailedAttempts: 0
    - ShowAlterPasswordWarning: false
----
<1> The next time the user is allowed to attempt login.

If the user running the command has the `READ_USER` privilege, information on all users is displayed.
Otherwise, only the current user's information is displayed.

== View privileges of a user

Users with the `READ_USER` privilege in a scope can view the RBAC privileges of the users in that scope.

=== Syntax

[#_grant_a_role_to_a_user]
== Grant a role to a user/proxy group

=== Syntax

[source,gsql]
----
GRANT ROLE <role_name1> (, role_name2)* [ON GRAPH <graph_name>]
  TO <username1>|<proxy_group_name1> (, <username2> | <proxy_group_name>2)*
----

=== Required privilege

`WRITE_ROLE`

=== Procedure

. Start the GSQL shell and make sure you are using the correct graph
+
[source,console]
----
$ gsql
GSQL > USE GRAPH example_graph
----

. From the GSQL shell, run the `GRANT ROLE` command. You can grant multiple roles to multiple users:
+
[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > GRANT ROLE role1 , role2 ON GRAPH example_graph TO user1, user2
----

The above command will grant roles `role1` and `role2` on graph `example_graph` to users `user1` and `user2`.

----
$ gsql
GSQL > USE GRAPH example_graph
----

+
[source,gsql]
----
GSQL > REVOKE ROLE role1, role2 ON GRAPH example_graph
        FROM user1, user2
----

The above command will revoke roles `role1` and `role2` on graph `example_graph` from users `user1` and `user2`.

== Change a user's password

Users with the `WRITE_USER` privilege can change the passwords of other users.
