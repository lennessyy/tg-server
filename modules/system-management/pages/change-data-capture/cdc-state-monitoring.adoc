= CDC State Monitoring

== State Monitoring
.Check the state of CDC Service with this command:
[console]
----
grun_p gpe "cat $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/cdc.yaml"
----

The cdc state file should only exist on GPE Replica 1 node of each partition:

* `GPE_1#1`
* `GPE_2#1`

.The response will look like this:
[console]
----

### ---- (m2)_10.128.0.84 ---1--

.For each CDC state field, see the table below:
[cols="2", separator=¦ ]
|===
¦ Field ¦ Meaning

¦ `tid`
¦ The tid is the tid of the delta batch (largest tid) that was most recently written to external kafka.
For a transaction, it’s the tid of the last delta batch for the transaction (must be COMMIT), which can be used to represent the transaction id.

¦ `safe_persistent_tid`
¦ The `safe_persistent_tid` is the tid of the earliest delta batch among all open transactions that are not committed/rolled-back in CDC.
If there’s no open transactions, this is the same as tid.

All delta batches with `tid < safe_persistent_tid` must have been written to external kafka.

¦ `split_index`
¦ For non-transaction, it’s always 0. For transactions, the split_index is the index of the delta batch that was most recently written to external kafka among all delta batches for the same transaction.

¦`index`
¦ The index is an index of delta messages in a delta batch that was most recently written to external kafka.

== State of DIM Service

.Check the state of DIM(Deleted Id Map) service with this command:
[console]
----
grun_p gpe "cat $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deleted_idmap_state.yaml"
----

.Check disk usage of DIM(Deleted Id Map) service with this command:
[console]
----
grun_p gpe "du -sh $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deletedID_store"
----

The dim state file exists on all GPE nodes, unlike the cdc state file.

.The response will look like this:
[console]
----
------------ Output example for deleted_idmap_state.yaml on 1x2 cluster ------------
### ---- (m1)_10.128.0.77 ---0--
posted_delta_curr_tid: 3752092

stored_deletedvid_curr_tid: 2275848

[CAUTION]
====
The purging task runs every 30 minutes by default.

.For each DIM state field, see the table below:
[cols="2", separator=¦ ]
|===
¦ Field ¦ Meaning

¦`posted_delta_curr_tid`
¦ When reading a delta message with `tid=tid_origin` that contains a vertex deletion message, TigerGraph will collect `uid` for deleted vertex, then build a special vid-uid delta, and post back to deltaQ.
The `posted_delta_curr_tid` is the most recently posted delta’s `tid_origin`.

¦ `posted_delta_next_split_index`
¦ The `posted_delta_next_split_index` is the most recently posted delta’s `split_index` + 1.

All `vertex-deletion` deltas with (`tid`, `split_index`) smaller than (`posted_delta_curr_tid`, `posted_delta_next_split_index`) will be handled by main delta handling process to generate an extra `deleted vid` delta into deltaQ.

¦ `stored_deletedvid_curr_tid`
¦ When processing the special `vid-uid` delta for a deleted vertex, TigerGraph saves the `vid-uid` entry in the local RocksDB.
The variable `stored_deletedvid_curr_tid` represents the `tid_origin` of the most recently stored delta, indicating it has been flushed to disk, not solely in memory.

All `deleted vid` deltas with an origin `tid` smaller than this value (excluding it) have already been processed and stored in RocksDB.

Note: The `idmap` is cached in memory, and if the map size is small (configured in `GPE.BasicConfig.Env` as `DIMCacheLimitInMB`, set at `30MB`), it is not flushed to disk.
Consequently, this `tid` may lag behind in such cases.

¦`purged_deletedvid_curr_tid`
¦ Periodically, TigerGraph purges the entries in RocksDB based on the `safe_persistent_tid`.
This is because the CDC already used some of the `vid-uid` entries and wrote to external Kafka, hence we don’t need these entries anymore.

¦ `purged_deletedvid_next_tid`
¦ Purges `deleted vid` delta’s `tid_origin`.
The `tid_orgin` represents the `tid` of origin delta that contains the vertex deletion message.
All `deleted vid-uid` entries with `tid_orgin` smaller than this already have been purged from RocksDB.

Configure this with `GPE.BasicConfig.Env: DIMPurgeIntervalInMin`), and update this `tid` if purging is actually performed.

== CDC Reset

Please run the following steps to reset cdc.

. Stop related services
+
[console]
----
gadmin stop gpe -y
----
+
[NOTE]
====
After a CDC reset, the previous data updates before `stop gpe` will be ignored by TigerGraph CDC.
Only new data updates will be produced to external kafka.
====


. Clear state and data files for cdc
+
[console]
----
grun_p gpe "rm $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/files/cdc#*"
grun_p gpe "rm $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/cdc.yaml"
grun_p gpe "rm $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deleted_idmap_state.yaml"
grun_p gpe "rm -rf $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deletedID_store"
----

. Start services
+
[console]
----
gadmin start all
----
