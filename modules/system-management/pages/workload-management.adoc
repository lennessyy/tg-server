:description: Overview of workload management in TigerGraph.

This page explains the different methods available to manage system workloads in TigerGraph.

In distributed or replicated clusters, users have multiple processing units at their disposal. Depending on their needs, they can configure xref:#_query_routing_schemes[query routing schemes] such as round-robin or CPU load-aware routing. For replicated clusters, queries can also be xref:#_specify_replica_to_run_query_on[directed to specific replicas].


[#_workload_queues]
== Workload Queues
Workload Queues help manage queries by routing them to predefined queues with specific configurations.
Each queue can have properties like the maximum number of concurrent queries and delay queue size, preventing system overload.
Queries can be assigned to queues based on user roles and permissions.

In 3.10, *workload queues* were introduced. Multiple independent queues can be configured, allowing application designers to decide how specific operations are handled.

Workload queues manage the following types of operations:

* Running an installed query.
* Interpreting ad-hoc queries.
* Executing heavy built-in queries, commonly used for "Explore Graph" in GraphStudio.

=== Configure Workload Queues
Workload queues help control how queries are executed within the system by defining limits such as the maximum number of concurrent queries and the maximum size of the delay queue.
Administrators can configure workload queues by creating, modifying, or deleting them as needed.

Before making changes, it’s a good practice to retrieve the current configuration using the *GET Workload Queue* command. After reviewing, you can update or apply new configurations using the *PUT Workload Queue* command.

*GSQL Commands*

* *Retrieve Current Configuration:*
[source.wrap,gsql]
----
GET WORKLOAD QUEUE
----

* *Update Configuration:*
[source.wrap,gsql]
----
PUT WORKLOAD QUEUE FROM "/path/to/queue.json"
----

*REST Endpoints*

* *Retrieve Current Configuration:*
[source.wrap]
----
GET /gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/configs
----

* *Configure Workload Queues*
[source.wrap]
----
POST /gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/configs
----

*Examples*

1.  *Retrieve Current Configuration:*
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X GET -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
  <hostname>:<nginx-port>/gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/configs
----

2. *Modify Workload Queue Configuration:*
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X POST -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
<hostname>:<nginx-port>/gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/configs \
-d '{"isEnabled":true,"queues":{"OLTP":{"description":"OLTP queries","isDefault":false,"maxConcurrentQueries":100,"maxDelayQueueSize":200}}}'
----

*Response Status Codes*

*For GET Workload Queue*
[cols="20h,~"]
|===
|Status Code|Description
|200|The queue configurations were successfully retrieved.
|403|The user does not have the READ_WORKLOAD_QUEUE privilege.
|500|Server error occurred while processing the request.
|===

*For PUT Workload Queue*
[cols="20h,~"]
|===
|Status Code|Description
|200|The queue configurations were successfully uploaded.
|400|The payload is ill-formed.
|403|The user does not have the WRITE_WORKLOAD_QUEUE privilege.
|409|Conflict in the configuration, such as multiple queues set as default.
|500|Server error occurred while processing the request.
|===

*maxConcurrentQueries and maxDelayQueueSize*
Each workload queue has two critical properties to manage system resources:

1. *maxConcurrentQueries:* Defines the maximum number of queries that can run simultaneously in a queue. This helps prevent resource contention and ensures that the system does not become overloaded.

2. *maxDelayQueueSize:* Specifies the maximum number of queries that can wait in a queue when the current workload exceeds the concurrent query limit. If this limit is reached, new queries are rejected until the queue has capacity.

[NOTE]
====
Both properties are enforced at the per-machine level in a cluster.
Setting the values too high may degrade performance. It’s recommended to keep `maxConcurrentQueries` below three times the number of physical CPU cores in a machine.

Any configuration changes require a GPE restart to take effect.
====

=== List Workload Queues
Displays a list of all workload queues available to the current user, including their configurations and permissions.

*GSQL Command*
[source.wrap,gsql]
----
LIST WORKLOAD QUEUE
----

*REST Endpoints*
[source.wrap]
----
GET /restpp/workload-manager/queue
----

*Example Request*
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X GET -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
  <hostname>:<nginx-port>/restpp/workload-manager/queue
----

*Example Response*
The response will include the information available to the general users.
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "id": "AdHoc",
    "description": "Ad-hoc queries",
    "isDefault": true
  },
  {
    "id": "OLTP",
    "description": "OLTP queries"
  }
]
----

*Response Status Codes*
[cols="20h,~"]
|===
|Status Code|Description

|200|The queue info has been retrieved successfully.
|403|The user doesn't have the privilege `READ_DATA`.
|===

=== Grant/Revoke Workload Queue Access
You can grant or revoke workload queues to a user based on its user name, groups, and/or roles.

*GSQL Command*
[source.wrap,gsql]
----
# GRANT
GRANT WORKLOAD QUEUE <queue_name> TO USER <user1>, <user2>

# REVOKE
REVOKE WORKLOAD QUEUE <queue_name> FROM USER <user1>, <user2>
----

*REST Endpoint*
[source.wrap]
----
POST /gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/permission
----

*Request Body*
The request body expects a JSON object with the following schema:
[source, json]
----
{
  "OLTP": {
    "granted": {
      "USER": []
      "GROUP": ["*"]
      "ROLE": ["r1", "r2"]
    }
  }
}
----
The request body must have the following fields at the top level:
[cols="20h,~,20h"]
|===
|Field|Description|Data type
|`action`|`GRANT` or `REVOKE` (case insensitive)|`STRING`
|`queue`|The ID of the queue to be granted or revoked.|`STRING`
|`user` (optional)|The list of the user names to be granted/revoked.|`STRING` or `STRING[]`
|`group` (optional)|The list of the group names to be granted/revoked.|`STRING` or `STRING[]`
|`role` (optional)|The list of the role names to be granted/revoked.|`STRING` or `STRING[]`
|===

[TIP]
====
* You can use the wildcard " * " to grant/revoke the queue to all users, groups, or roles.
* Note that " * " must be the only entry in the list when available.
====

*Example Request*
Grant the queue `OLTP` to the user `u1` and `u2`:
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X GET -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
  <hostname>:<nginx-port>/gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/permission \
  -d '{"action": "grant", "queue": "OLTP", "user": ["u1", "u2"]}'
----

Revoke the queue `scheduled_jobs` from all users and the role `r1`:
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X GET -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
  <hostname>:<nginx-port>/gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/permission \
  -d '{"action": "REVOKE" "queue": "scheduled_jobs", "user": "*", role": ["r1"]}'
----

===== Response Status Codes
[cols="20h,~"]
|===
|Status Code|Description
|200|The queue has been granted/revoked successfully.
|400|The payload is ill-formed so none of the given entities could be granted/revoked.
|403|The user doesn't have the privilege `WRITE_WORKLOAD_QUEUE``
|===

[NOTE]
====
Unlike REST API, the GSQL commands don't allow you to specify USER, GROUP, and ROLE in a command.
You must use separate commands for each entity type.
====

=== Show Workload Queue Permissions

The `SHOW WORKLOAD QUEUE` command lists detailed information about workload queues, including their permissions, descriptions, and limits. It is primarily used to inspect queue settings and permissions.

*GSQL Command*
To show the permission info of all queues:
[source.wrap,gsql]
----
SHOW WORKLOAD QUEUE
----

To show the permission info of a specific queue, for example `OLTP`:
[source.wrap,gsql]
----
SHOW WORKLOAD QUEUE OLTP
----

*REST Endpoint*
[source.wrap]
----
GET /gsqlserver/gsql/workload-manager/permission
----

*Example Request*
To retrieve the permission info of the queue `OLTP`:
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X GET -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
  localhost:14240/gsql/v1/workload-manager/permission?id=OLTP
----

*Example Response*
The response will be the combination of configs and permission, e.g.
[source, json]
----
{
  "OLTP": {
    "description": "OLTP queries",
    "isDefault": false,
    "maxConcurrentQueries": 100,
    "maxDelayQueueSize": 200,
    "granted": {
      "USER": [],
      "GROUP": ["*"],
      "ROLE": ["r1", "r2"]
    }
  }
}
----

*Response Status Codes*
[cols="20h,~"]
|===
|Status Code|Description

|200|The queue info has been retrieved successfully.
|403|The user doesn't have the privilege `READ_WORKLOAD_QUEUE`.
|===

[NOTE]
====
* Use `SHOW WORKLOAD QUEUE` to inspect queue configurations and access permissions.
* This command focuses on *visibility of queue settings*, unlike `GET WORKLOAD QUEUE`, which exports configurations.
====

=== Check Queue Status
You can use the following API to check the status of the workload queues for monitoring purposes.

[source.wrap]
----
POST /restpp/workload-manager/queuestatus
----
Return the status of the given workload queue on each GPE instance.

*Request Body*
[cols="20h,~,20h"]
|===
|Field|Description|Data type
|queuelist (optional)|The list of the ID of the WorkloadQueue. If not specified, all queues will be shown.|`STRING[]`
|mode (optional)|`stats` or `verbose` (case-sensitive). If not specified, `stats` will be used.|`STRING`
|===

For `mode` field, if `stats` is specified, response only gives the numbers of queries waiting and running. If `verbose` is specified, the response will include the the request Ids of the queries that are waiting and running.

If Request Body is not provided, response is generated as if both fields are using the default values.

*Example Request*
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X POST -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
  <hostname>:<nginx-port>/restpp/workload-manager/queuestatus \
   -d '{"queuelist": ["AdHoc"], "mode": "verbose"}'
----

        ]
      }
    }
  ],

}
----

=== Use Cases
Suppose we have configured the following workload queues that are the output of the `SHOW WORKLOAD QUEUE` command:
[source, json]
----
{
  "OLTP": {
    "description": "OLTP queries",
    "isDefault": true,
    "maxConcurrentQueries": 100,
    "maxDelayQueueSize": 100,
    "granted": {
      "USER": [],
      "GROUP": ["g1", "g2"],
      "ROLE": []
    }
  },
  "scheduled_jobs": {
    "description": "Scheduled jobs",
    "maxConcurrentQueries": 5,
    "maxDelayQueueSize": 0,
    "granted": {
      "USER": ["u1"],
      "GROUP": [],
      "ROLE": ["r1"]
    }
  },
  "AdHoc": {
    "description": "Ad-hoc queries",
    "isDefault": false,
    "maxConcurrentQueries": 10,
    "maxDelayQueueSize": 10,
    "granted": {
      "USER": [],
      "GROUP": ["g3"],
      "ROLE": ["r2"]
    }
  }
}
----

*Running a Query*
When running a query, you can specify the workload queue to run the query on.
If the queue is not specified, the query will be routed to the default queue.
To specify the queue in the GSQL shell, you can use the `-queue` option, e.g.
----
RUN QUERY -queue AdHoc q1()
----

or you can use the HTTP header `Workload-Queue`:
[source.warp, bash]
----
curl -X POST -u tigergraph:tigergraph \
  -H "Workload-Queue: AdHoc" \
  <hostname>:14240/restpp/query/ldbc_snb/q1"
----

If the given queue is not granted to the current user, the query will be rejected with the error code `REST-14000` and return `HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity`.

For example, if the user `tigergraph` who does not belong to the group `g3` or holds the role `r2` tries to run a query on the queue `AdHoc`, the query will be rejected.

[NOTE]
====
If the queue is full of capacity, the query will be rejected.
====

== Other Query Workload Management Methods

=== Limit number of concurrent heavy queries

WARNING: This configuration is deprecated as of TG 3.10.0 and will be removed in a future release.
This is ignored once the xref:#_workload_queue[workload queue] feature is enabled.

TigerGraph has a few built-in queries that are memory-intensive, here referred to as "heavy".
These queries tend to be invoked by applications such as GraphStudio.
You can set a limit of how many of these heavy queries are allowed to run concurrently by configuring the parameter `RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxHeavyBuiltinQueries` with the xref:management-commands.adoc#_gadmin_config[`gadmin config` command].

For example, to set the maximum number of heavy built-in queries to 10, run the following command:

[source.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin config set RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxHeavyBuiltinQueries 10
----

You must xref:manage-services.adoc#_start_stop_or_restart_a_service[restart the RESTPP service] for the change to take effect.

=== Limit number of concurrent queries

WARNING: This configuration is deprecated as of TG 3.10.0 and will be removed in a future release.
This is ignored once the xref:#_workload_queue[workload queue] feature is enabled.

You can use the `RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxConcurrentQueries` parameter to set a limit of how many queries are allowed to be running concurrently.
The count of these queries *does not include* the built-in heavy queries.

For example, to specify that there can only be 50 concurrent queries at a time, excluding the heavy built-in queries, change the value of the configuration parameter to 50 with the xref:management-commands.adoc#_gadmin_config[`gadmin config` command]:

[source.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin config set RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxConcurrentQueries 50
----

If the maximum number of concurrent queries is reached, newly submitted queries are placed in a delay queue, and begin to run as the currently running queries finish.
If the queue is at capacity, newly submitted queries are rejected. and you need wait until there is capacity to run the query again.
You can adjust the size of the queue with the configuration parameter `RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxDelayQueueSize`.

For example, to specify that a maximum 20 queries may remain in the queue, run the following command:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin config set RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxDelayQueueSize 20
----

You must xref:manage-services.adoc#_start_stop_or_restart_a_service[restart the RESTPP service] for the change to take effect.

=== Specify replica to run query on

On a distributed cluster, you can specify on which replica you want a query to be run through the xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_run_an_installed_query_post[Run Query REST endpoint].

For example, to run the query on the primary cluster, use the `GSQL-REPLICA` header when running a query and set its value to 1:

.Specify that the query run on the primary cluster
[source.wrap,bash]
----
curl -X POST -H "GSQL-REPLICA: 1" -d '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}'
"http://localhost:14240/restpp/query/social/hello"
----

== Query Routing Schemes

In a distributed or replicated cluster, REST++ automatically routes queries to different GPEs, in order to spread the workload.

NOTE: If xref:_specify_replica_to_run_query_on[GSQL-REPLICA] header is used when invoking a query, this header overrides the routing scheme for that query.

=== Round Robin routing

The default query routing scheme is round-robin.
The first query is managed by GPE 0, the next query by GPE 1, and so on.
After the last GPE, the cycle returns to GPE 0.

Version 3.9.3 adds a system configuration parameter `RESTPP.CPULoadAware.Mode` to enable system administrators to select other query routing schemes:

* Mode = 0 (default): Round-Robin
* Mode = 1: CPU Load Aware

=== CPU Load Aware Query Routing

When this query routing mode is selected, REST++ tries to direct incoming queries to the GPEs that are currently less busy.

Specifically, the system periodically polls CPU usage data to find a GPE whose CPU usage percentage is below
`RESTPP.QueryRouting.TargetSelectionCPUThreshold` (default 50).

If no GPE satisfies the CPU threshold condition, REST++ falls back to the default behavior (round-robin selection).

.Example: Change CPU Load Threshold and Enable CPU Load Aware routing
[source, console]
$ gadmin config entry RESTPP.QueryRouting.TargetSelectionCPUThreshold 40
$ gadmin config entry RESTPP.QueryRouting.Mode 1
