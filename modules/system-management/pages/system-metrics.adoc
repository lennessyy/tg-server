= Metrics Reporting
:description: Overview of metrics gathering in TigerGraph Server.

You can use `gadmin metric` commands to collect the following metrics related to state of resource usage on your instances:

* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Disk space usage
* Network-related information

For a full list of options available to `gadmin metric`, see xref:management-commands.adoc#_gadmin_metric[`gadmin metric`] or run `gadmin metric -h` in the command line to view the help text for the command.

== Report CPU usage

Use the command `gadmin metric -t cpu` to report CPU usage by different TigerGraph services on a cluster or a node in the cluster.

To report CPU usage on select nodes, use the `--host` flag or the `-m` shorthand, followed by the nodes for which you want CPU usage data, separated by commas.
If you choose not to specify nodes, then the command reports CPU usage for all nodes in the cluster.

To select specific services to report data for, specify the service IDs after the command.
If you don't specify a service, the command reports data for all services.

NOTE: Service ids currently include the following:
`gpe gse restpp gsql ifm gui ctrl kafka etcd zk nginx dict admin kafkaconn kafkastrm-ll`

The following command reports CPU usage by the `GUI` service for m1 and m2:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin metric gui -t cpu -m m1,m2
----

The following command reports CPU usage by all services for m1 and m2:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin metric gui -t cpu -m m1,m2
----



== Report memory usage

Use command `gadmin metric -t mem` to report memory usage on a cluster or a node in the cluster.

To report memory usage on select nodes, use the `--host` flag or the `-m` shorthand, followed by the nodes for which you want memory usage data.
If you choose not to specify nodes, then the command reports memory usage for all nodes in the cluster.

To select specific services to report data for, specify the service IDs after the command.
If you don't specify a service, the command reports data for all services.

NOTE: Service ids currently include the following:
`gpe gse restpp gsql ifm gui ctrl kafka etcd zk nginx dict admin kafkaconn kafkastrm-ll`

The following command reports memory usage by the `GUI` service for m1 and m2:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin metric gui -t mem -m m1,m2
----


The following command reports memory usage by all services for m1 and m2:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin metric -t mem -m m1,m2
----

== Report disk space usage

Use command `gadmin metric -t disk` to report disk space usage for a cluster or select nodes in a cluster.

To report network information on select nodes, use the `--host` flag or the `-m` shorthand, followed by the nodes for which you want disk usage data.
If you choose not to specify nodes, then the command reports data for all nodes in the cluster.

The following command reports disk usage for m1 and m2:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin metric -t disk -m m1,m2
----

== Report network connections and traffic

Use command `gadmin metric -t net` to report TCP connections and network I/O for a cluster or select nodes in a cluster.

The command reports three data points for each node:

* `TCP CONNS`: number of open connections.
* `IN`: Network inflow since the node started.
* `OUT`: Network outflow since the node started.

To report network information on select nodes, use the `--host` flag or the `-m` shorthand, followed by the nodes for which you want network data.
If you choose not to specify nodes, then the command reports data for all nodes in the cluster.

The following command reports network information for m1 and m2:

[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin metric -t net -m m1,m2
----
