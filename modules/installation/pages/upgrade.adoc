= Upgrading an Existing Installation

This page describes the steps to upgrade an existing installation of
TigerGraph to TigerGraph {page-component-version}.

== Before you begin
If you are upgrading from a version older than 3.2:

* First perform a backup *and a restore* xref:backup-and-restore:index.adoc[using GBAR (Graph Backup and Restore)] on your existing installation.
This step is necessary because TigerGraph 3.2 made major changes to the Graph Storage Engine and a restore is needed to remove certain files that would make the upgrade operation fail.
* After restoring the backup, ensure that there are no vertex inserts or deletions before starting the upgrade.


[[upgrading-from-v3x]]
== Upgrading from v3.x

Any 3.x version of TigerGraph can be upgraded to another v3.x version by
running the installation script with the upgrade(`+-U+`) flag.

. Download the latest version of TigerGraph to your system.
. Extract the tar file.
. Run the installation script under the Linux user created during
installation with the upgrade flag (`+-U+`) that was extracted from the
tar file:

....
$ ./install.sh -U
....

[NOTE]
====
Please upgrade from the most recent maintenance version in any minor release.
If you are upgrading from a version that does not have the most recent patches applied to its minor version, upgrade to the most recent patches first before upgrading to another minor or major version.
For example, if you are upgrading from 3.5.0 to {page-component-version}, upgrade to 3.5.3 first using the installation script and then upgrade to {page-component-version}.

Additionally, versions upgrading from 3.0 or 3.1 must first go through 3.2.4.
For example, if you are running version 3.1.3, you must first upgrade to 3.1.6, then 3.2.4, then to {page-component-version}.
