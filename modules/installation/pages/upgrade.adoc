= Upgrading an Existing Installation
:toc:
This page describes the steps to upgrade an existing installation of
TigerGraph to TigerGraph {page-component-version}.

== Before you begin

===  Check release notes for changes in functionality

[IMPORTANT]
Always check the xref:release-notes:index.adoc[] for all the versions between your current version and your target version, for deprecated features, known issues, or other behavioral changes.
You may need to make migration changes to your TigerGraph application either before or after the upgrade.
If you have any questions or uncertainty, please contact TigerGraph Support.

==== User-defined function (UDF) compatibility

TigerGraph version 3.9 introduced changes in the way user-defined functions are accepted by the system.

* Some UDFs may no longer be accepted due to xref:security:index.adoc#_udf_file_scanning[increased security screening].
* UDFs may no longer be called `to_string()`. This is now a built-in GSQL function.
* UDF names may no longer use the `tg_` prefix.

If any UDFs do not satisfy these restrictions, then they will not be installed. GSQL will return these errors:

.Reserved `tg_` prefix error
[source, console]
----
The following function name(s) contain errors:
  [reserved 'tg_']: tg_myFunction

Please rename the corresponding functions in: ExprFunctions.hpp
----

.Reserved `to_string()` function name
[source, console]
----
Following GSQL built-in function name(s): [to_string] can not be used again for user defined function name(s)!
GSQL built-in functions are case-insensitive. Please rename corresponding user defined functions in ExprFunctions.hpp.
----

Any user-defined function previously used in an older TigerGraph version that does not comply with these requirements must be renamed or removed in `ExprFunctions.hpp`.

=== Make a Backup

[IMPORTANT]
====
As a precaution, it is always a good idea to make a full backup before performing a major system change like an upgrade.
System upgrade does not support version rollback at this time.
====

=== Prepare a pre-3.2 database

. First perform a backup xref:backup-and-restore:index.adoc[using GBAR (Graph Backup and Restore)] on your existing installation.
. *Restore* your installation with GBAR to rebuild it.
This step is necessary because TigerGraph 3.2 made major changes to the Graph Storage Engine and a restore is needed to remove certain files that would make the upgrade operation fail.
. Ensure that the restore is completely finished and there are no pending graph modifications (schema change, insert, update, or delete) before starting the upgrade.
You can do this by calling the xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_rebuild_graph_engine[/rebuildnow] endpoint and waiting until there are no more PullDelta messages being printed in the logs.

=== Ensure that the database is inactive

[IMPORTANT]
Ensure that the database will be inactive throughout the upgrade process.

. Stop any new database requests.
. Ensure that all previous operations such as queries, loading jobs, schema changes, and data updates and deletions are completely finished.
Check the appropriate logs.
Call the xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_rebuild_graph_engine[/rebuildnow] endpoint to force the data store to consume all pending updates and then wait until there are no more PullDelta messages being printed in the logs.

== Upgrading a CRR system
To upgrade the TigerGraph software on a CRR system, follow this sequence of steps.

. Disable CRR on your DR cluster.
+
[source.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin config set System.CrossRegionReplication.Enabled false
$ gadmin config apply -y
$ gadmin restart all -y
----

. Upgrade both the primary cluster and DR cluster, according to the instructions on this page.

. Enable CRR on the DR cluster.



[[upgrading-from-v3x]]
== Upgrading from v3.x

Any 3.x version of TigerGraph can be upgraded to another v3.x version by
running the installation script with the upgrade(`+-U+`) flag.

. Download the latest version of TigerGraph to your system.
. Extract the tar file.
. Run the installation script under the Linux user created during
installation with the upgrade flag (`+-U+`) that was extracted from the
tar file:

....
$ ./install.sh -U
....

[NOTE]
====
Please upgrade from the most recent maintenance version in any minor release.
If you are upgrading from a version that does not have the most recent patches applied to its minor version, upgrade to the most recent patches first before upgrading to another minor or major version.
For example, if you are upgrading from 3.5.0 to {page-component-version}, upgrade to 3.5.3 first using the installation script and then upgrade to {page-component-version}.

Additionally, versions upgrading from 3.0 or 3.1 must first go through 3.2.4.
For example, if you are running version 3.1.3, you must first upgrade to 3.1.6, then 3.2.4, then to {page-component-version}.
====


[[upgrading-from-v2x]]
== Upgrading from v2.x

Please contact TigerGraph Support to coordinate upgrading to TigerGraph version {page-component-version} if you are currently using a 2.x version of TigerGraph.
Even though all the steps are documented, it is strongly
recommended that you review the process with the TigerGraph
Support team.

Upgrading the Developer Edition or migrating to another edition are not supported.

For detailed upgrade procedures, see our support article on the
link:https://tigergraph.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8173584319892-2-6-x-to-3-x-upgrade-flow[2.6.x to 3.x upgrade flow]

[[upgrading-cloud-marketplace-image]]
== Upgrading Cloud Marketplace Images

=== Upgrading from 3.x

. xref:backup-and-restore:backup-and-restore.adoc[Back up] your TigerGraph instance using GBAR.
. Start a new instance from the latest cloud marketplace listing.
. Use the backup files you generated earlier to xref:backup-and-restore:backup-and-restore.adoc[restore] the new instance.

=== Upgrading from 2.x

If you want to upgrade your Cloud Marketplace image from v2.x on any cloud platform, please https://tigergraph.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/[open a support ticket]. for instructions and assistance.

== Known Issues and Workarounds

Several things may have changed between your current release and 3.9.x and these steps should help to upgrade the UDF file before starting the upgrade process or prepare users to address anything that may come up as a result of the upgrade.

=== `to_string()` is Now a Built-in Function:

In previous releases, `to_string()` was included in the default `ExprFunctions` file and is a common utility function added to the `ExprFunctions` file.

==== What to do:

Users need to rename or remove UDFs that are called `to_string()`.
Now, that it is added as a built-in function users are no longer needing to include it in the `ExprFunctions` file.

For more reference on how to prepare for an upgrade please refer back to the section: xref:tigergraph-server:installation:upgrade.adoc#_before_you_begin[Before You Begin].

=== `tg_` is Now a Reserved Keyword

TigerGraph uses the `tg_` prefix to denote functions provided by TigerGraph.

==== What to do:

Users can either rename, remove, or comment out any functions in their `ExprFunctions` file that contain this prefix.
Additionally, users should avoid prefixing future functions with this reserved prefix.
This is to avoid naming collisions with queries.

For more reference on how to prepare for an upgrade please refer back to the section: xref:tigergraph-server:installation:upgrade.adoc#_before_you_begin[Before You Begin].

=== UDF File Policy

There is some UDF enforcement taking place.
The UDF files are scanned to make sure they comply with the file policy.
This is to ensure there are none of the following:

. *Macros with a `replacement`.*
+
.Example:
[source,]
#define TABLE_SIZE 100
+
.Notice the macro without `replacement` is allowed
[source,]
#define EXPRFUNCTIONS_HPP_

. *`Headers` and `Includes` from potentially vulnerable C++ features*
+
If the header file is not included in our default `allowlist`, users can, at their own discretion, add C++ headers to an `allowlist`.
Users are free to edit the `allowlist` via `gadmin` config set `GSQL.UDF.Policy.HeaderAllowlist`.
+
Additionally, users can also disable a file policy after an upgrade with this command:
+
[source,]
----
gadmin config set GSQL.UDF.Policy.Enable false
----
This is so the restrictions will not take effect.

==== What to do:

It is recommended that users consult with the entire policy and adjust the UDF files to comply with the file policy.

For more reference please see:
https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/security/#_udf_file_scanning[UDF File Scanning].
