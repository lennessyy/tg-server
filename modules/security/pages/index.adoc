* https://www.tigergraph.com/soc-2/[SOC 2 Compliance]
* https://www.tigergraph.com/compliance/[PCI-DSS]

== Vulnerability scanning
TigerGraph leverages best-of-breed tools to periodically and proactively scan source code, application runtime, infrastructure to identify security vulnerabilities:

* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
* Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
* Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
* Penetration Testing
* Operating System (OS) Level Vulnerability Scanning
* Network Vulnerability Scanning

=== Vulnerability remediation

TigerGraph commits to vulnerability remediation upon discovery by the following timelines:

* Critical/high: 30 days
* Medium: 90 days
* Low: 180 days

[#_pgp_key]
== PGP key

TigerGraph Server download packages are signed with our PGP key.
This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the download package.

* Key ID: 413D1F12
* Fingerprint:E20D 2B61 FB38 57D4 3B8E  B321 67BD 323E 413D 1F12

You can also find our key on link:https://pgp.mit.edu[].

[#_udf_file_scanning]
== UDF file scanning

Available in TigerGraph 3.9+

TigerGraph users can upload xref:gsql-ref:querying:func/query-user-defined-functions.adoc[user-defined function (UDF) files] to the server and run them as part of a query or loading job.
In order to prevent security issues with code execution, TigerGraph Server disables this ability by default and requires it to be enabled manually by an administrator.

In addition, the UDF files are scanned to make sure they comply with the file policy. The scanning process, by default, consists of three parts.

The file scanning policy is controlled by a `gadmin` parameter, `GSQL.UDF.Policy.Enable`, which defaults to `true`. For more information, see the xref:reference:configuration-parameters.adoc[] page.

=== Disabled macros with replacement

Macros with replacement are not allowed, for example `#define TABLE_SIZE 100`.
However, macros without replacement can still be used, such as `#define EXPRFUNCTIONS_HPP`.

=== File header allowlist

Only the headers present in the allowlist can be included in UDF files.
UDF files with different headers will not be accepted.
The list is case-sensitive.

[source, json]
----
[
"stdlib.h", "string", "tuple",
"vector", "list", "deque", "arrays", "forward_list",
"queue", "priority_queue", "stack",
"set", "multiset", "map", "multimap",
"unordered_set", "unordered_multiset", "unordered_map", "unordered_multimap",
"iterator",
"sstream",
"algorithm", "math.h"
]
----

This is customizable with the `gadmin` command `GSQL.UDF.Policy.HeaderAllowlist`. `ExprUtil.hpp` and `tg_ExprUtil.hpp` are always allowed, and do not need to be declared in the allowlist.

=== Blocklist

TigerGraph also has a non-modifiable blocklist that prevents certain C{plus}{plus} features from being used.
For security reasons, this list is not publicly available.
Contact support@tigergraph.com for more details about the blocklist policy.
